# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Regression commit attribution.** Every evaluation run now records the
  git commit it was produced from (`commit` field in `results.json`) when
  it can be determined - reliably for Foundry hosted/prompt agents
  evaluated via cloud or azd execution in CI, and on a best-effort basis
  for local runs inside a git repository. When a metric regresses between
  two comparable runs that both have commit metadata, the evaluation
  report gains a "Regression Insight" section explaining, in plain
  language, what changed (system prompt, model, dataset, evaluators, or
  thresholds) and suggesting a corrective action - surfaced automatically
  in the same `report.md` already attached to the PR pipeline, with no new
  CI step required. Doctor's rolling-baseline regression check gains the
  same explanation in its finding's recommendation. Cockpit gains a new
  "Evaluation Version History" section listing every evaluated run with
  its commit and what changed relative to the previous run in its
  lineage, independent of whether that run regressed. This feature is
  purely additive and informational: no new CLI flags, no change to
  exit-code/threshold-gating behavior, and existing runs without commit
  metadata continue to work exactly as before.
  
## [0.15.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **Extension publication is stable-only.** Staging produces a downloadable
  VSIX candidate without Marketplace authentication or upload. Only stable
  releases publish, preventing pre-releases from reserving the stable version.
- **Marketplace publishing moves from PATs to Microsoft Entra OIDC.** Dedicated
  managed-identity environments and a shared tenant/profile-pinned publishing
  helper replace Marketplace PAT authentication. Permission-only preflight and
  staged rollout are documented; GitHub `RELEASE_PAT` and PyPI/TestPyPI Trusted
  Publishing are unchanged.
- **Marketplace permissions can be validated without publishing.** A dedicated
  discover/check workflow bootstraps the identity's profile ID and verifies its
  explicit publisher role behind environment approvals, without release uploads.


## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- **`execution: azd` supports the current `azd ai eval` command surface.**
  AgentOps now discovers `evals/azure.eval.yaml` alongside the legacy
  `eval.yaml`, classifies the recipe by content, and delegates to the matching
  azd surface: `azd ai eval` via the `azure.ai.evaluations` extension (azd
  1.27.1+), or the existing `azd ai agent eval` via `azure.ai.agents`. The
  evaluation is created, started, polled to a terminal state, and read back
  per-sample, then normalized into the same `results.json` and `report.md`
  contract as every other execution mode. Threshold binding, fail-closed
  behavior, baseline comparison, and the `0`/`2`/`1` exit codes are unchanged.
  Raw azd output is retained for successful and failed runs alike.

  The current surface fills `results.json` rows with one entry per sample,
  including failed and errored samples, and computes aggregate metrics as the
  mean of the per-sample scores, because the azd run object exposes only counts.
  Threshold keys that name a metric the recipe cannot produce are now rejected
  *before* the evaluation is submitted, so a typo never consumes a cloud run.

  `azure.ai.evaluations` is in preview and is not yet published to the default
  azd extension registry. The new surface is strictly opt-in: it activates only
  when a current-surface recipe exists, and `agentops eval init` continues to
  generate a legacy recipe while the extension is unavailable, so existing
  workspaces and fresh clones are unaffected.

### Changed
- **azd extension detection now reads structured output.** Availability is
  determined from `azd extension list --installed -o json` and matched on
  extension id, falling back to the previous text scan only when the structured
  form is unsupported. The human-readable table also lists uninstalled registry
  entries, so scanning it could report an extension as available before it was
  actually installed.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- **`agentops init` can discover evaluation targets from your Foundry project.**
  When a project endpoint is known, the wizard lists existing prompt agents,
  hosted agents, and model deployments so you can pick one instead of typing a
  reference by hand. Manual entry stays available, discovery failures degrade to
  a clear message rather than blocking setup, and `--no-prompt` and
  non-interactive runs never contact Azure.
- **Red-team readiness is verified against recorded scan evidence.** Doctor, the
  Cockpit and release evidence now read the recorded red-team run and compare its
  target fingerprint, risk categories, attack strategies and failure threshold
  against the current configuration, reporting `ready`, `threshold_breach`,
  `missing_categories`, `target_mismatch`, `stale` or `cannot_verify`. A
  threshold breach blocks release evidence; anything else unverified warns.
- **Production alerting is verified against Azure Monitor.** The new
  `agentops.utils.alert_discovery` module resolves the Foundry-linked Application
  Insights resource and lists metric and scheduled-query alert rules read-only,
  checking each for enabled state, scope, a firing condition, and at least one
  enabled action group. Results are reduced to non-sensitive snapshots: action
  groups are reported as a count and enabled state only, never receiver
  addresses, phone numbers, or webhooks.

### Changed
- **Renamed the `[agent]` packaging extra to `[cockpit]` with no compatibility
  alias.** Install Doctor and Cockpit dependencies with
  `agentops-accelerator[cockpit]`. All docs, README, workflow and pipeline
  templates, skills, and plugin docs now reference `[cockpit]`.
- **The evaluation target is optional.** `agent:` may now be omitted from
  `agentops.yaml`. `agentops init` offers a guided menu of the five target kinds
  plus "decide later", and a workspace without a target runs in an
  observability-only mode where eval-dependent readiness checks report `n/a`
  instead of failing. Commands that genuinely require a target fail with a single
  explicit message.
- **Observability readiness only reports what it can actually verify.** Multi-turn
  coverage is treated as a dataset property and inferred solely from conversation
  rows; rubric evaluators count as ready only when they are both declared and
  threshold-bound; the scheduled-evaluation card is informational and appears only
  when a cron-scheduled workflow exists. Next Actions are emitted only for `warn`
  and `cannot_verify` checks, and an uninitialised workspace gets exactly one
  onboarding action.
- **`agentops cockpit` points you at Doctor when the workspace needs it.** Startup
  prints Doctor guidance only when the workspace is initialised and has findings.
  The Application Insights pre-flight check now warns when a Foundry endpoint is
  configured without App Insights and skips when neither is set, instead of
  reporting a hard failure.
- **The scheduled Doctor workflow propagates Doctor's exit code.** The generated
  GitHub Actions watchdog uploads artifacts and writes its step summary with
  `if: always()`, then exits with Doctor's captured code so a failing scheduled run
  is visible in CI. The Azure DevOps pipeline already failed correctly and is
  unchanged.

### Removed
- **Deep observability and agent-lifecycle capabilities move to a separate
  accelerator.** AgentOps no longer ships Observe, hosted Cockpit deployment,
  `agentops cockpit deploy`, the legacy `agentops agent` command group, its
  Copilot Extension server, its Entra Agent ID registration flow, or the
  unverified trace-sampling, trace-replay, and configuration-text alert
  detectors. The local Cockpit, Doctor, verified Azure Monitor alert inventory,
  readiness checks, history, and evaluation-run views remain available here.

### Fixed
- **Foundry project links now open the configured project instead of the tenant
  landing page.** In project-observability-only mode there is no cloud evaluation
  report from which to recover a portal URL, so Cockpit previously fell back to
  `ai.azure.com/?tid=...`. It now resolves the endpoint to its project ARM ID and
  opens Foundry's project overview with the correct `wsid` and tenant.
- **Missing Azure Monitor alerts no longer manufacture readiness work.** An
  absent alert rule is now treated as optional and hidden rather than producing
  a “Complete readiness: Alerts wired” action. Existing but broken alert
  configurations still surface because they represent explicit operational
  intent that needs repair.
- **Cockpit no longer opens a redundant, unbounded-feeling Doctor query in App
  Insights.** The “View findings in App Insights” link queried the high-volume
  dependency table for finding spans that Cockpit already renders locally and
  could remain in progress for minutes. Doctor findings now stay in the local
  Doctor section; App Insights links are reserved for operational telemetry.
- **Next actions no longer imply that Doctor itself is broken.** Finding actions
  now use “Fix: …” and “View finding details” instead of “Fix Doctor: …” and
  “Open Doctor finding”, making it clear that Doctor detected the underlying
  production or readiness problem.
- **Doctor charts now explain every data point.** Hovering or focusing a
  sparkline point shows both the analysis timestamp and the measured quantity,
  including explicit zero values. Remaining outdated terminology in Cockpit was
  replaced with “Doctor”.
- **Cockpit no longer mistakes AgentOps for the monitored agent.** In
  project-observability-only mode, agent tracing, continuous evaluation, and
  rubric rows are hidden instead of scanning AgentOps source files as though
  they were an agent runtime. Continuous evaluation is no longer marked ready
  merely because the latest Doctor run emitted no related finding.
- **Doctor summary removes duplicated charts and vague state.** The redundant
  Last analysis sparkline was removed, its timestamp now appears as section
  context, and the Findings badge reports an explicit trend instead of “open”.
- **Cockpit status cards use professional, descriptive states.** Alarm-style
  all-caps GO/NO-GO labels were replaced with Monitoring only, Ready, Needs
  attention, Not assessed, Review findings, Blocked, and No findings.
- **Doctor findings now state the measured value and the threshold that was
  crossed.** `errors.production_rate`, `latency.p95_production`,
  `latency.eval_avg` and `opex.no_thresholds` previously said only "above
  threshold" or "has no explicit thresholds", forcing a trip to the docs to find
  out which number applied. Each title now carries the observed value, the sample
  it came from where relevant, and the configured limit. `opex.no_thresholds` is
  now omitted entirely in project-observability-only workspaces because no eval
  gate exists until an `agent:` target is configured. The same applicability
  rule now suppresses PR-gate, release-evidence, and continuous-evaluation
  findings when no evaluation target exists.
- **Production error-rate findings now state their telemetry window.** The
  percentage and request counts come from Application Insights over the last
  seven days by default, or the period selected with `--lookback-days`; the
  finding title and evidence now include that period explicitly. They also name
  the queried Application Insights target and state that the rate aggregates all
  requests and dependencies in that resource rather than filtering to one agent.
- **Third-party HTTP logs can no longer break through into the terminal.**
  `httpx`, `openai`, `httpcore`, `urllib3` and the Azure SDK loggers now get a
  private `WARNING`-level handler and `propagate = False`, so an `INFO` line such
  as `HTTP Request: GET .../openai/v1/evals?limit=10` cannot interrupt the Doctor
  spinner even when a dependency resets the log level, clears our filter, or
  calls `logging.basicConfig(force=True)`. `--verbose` reverses this and shows
  every record again. Normal operator mode now globally suppresses all
  non-actionable `INFO` records, including handlers installed after startup.
- **The Doctor finding summary no longer leaves an orphan word or short phrase
  on the last line.** Titles were wrapped at a fixed 110 columns regardless of
  the real terminal width. Wrapping now uses the actual terminal size and picks
  the most evenly balanced line lengths.
- **Doctor only calls an error rate `critical` when it is unambiguously broken.**
  `errors.production_rate` escalated to `critical` at twice the warning bar, so a
  13% failure rate on a development workspace was reported as a release blocker.
  Escalation now uses a dedicated `critical_rate_threshold` (default 25%),
  configurable per workspace in `agent.yaml`.
- **`agentops.yaml` and `eval.yaml` are no longer reported as missing datasets.**
  The spec-kit reference extractor classified any backticked `.yaml`/`.yml`
  filename as an evaluation dataset, so `opex.spec_conformance.dataset_drift`
  listed configuration files that were never meant to live under
  `.agentops/data/`. Only `.jsonl` files are treated as datasets now, and the
  finding explains in plain language what is missing and how to fix it.
- **Third-party `INFO` lines no longer break through the Doctor spinner.** The
  noise filter was installed only on the root handler, which a dependency
  calling `logging.basicConfig(force=True)` replaces outright, letting
  `INFO: HTTP Request: ...` back onto the console. The filter now also lives on
  the noisy loggers themselves, where nothing in the standard library can clear
  it, and the `llm_assist` temperature-retry notice dropped from `info` to
  `debug`.
- **Doctor no longer raises latency and error-rate alarms on tiny samples, and
  the latency bar is realistic.** `latency.p95_production` and
  `errors.production_rate` compared an Application Insights p95 and failure ratio
  against their thresholds regardless of how many requests the lookback window
  actually held, so a smoke test with three requests could report a "33%
  production error rate". Both checks now require at least `min_requests`
  (default 20) requests in the window, configurable per check in `agent.yaml`,
  and the latency summary states the sample size it graded. The default
  `checks.latency.p95_threshold_seconds` also moved from 5 to 15 seconds, which
  matches what an agent turn that calls a model and one or two tools actually
  costs.
- **The Doctor LLM judge recovers from models that reject an explicit
  `temperature`.** Reasoning-family deployments answer `temperature: 0.0` with
  HTTP 400 `unsupported_value`, which surfaced as repeated
  `llm_assist: judge call failed` warnings mid-run. The client now detects that
  specific rejection, caches the capability, and retries once without the
  parameter.
- **Doctor no longer prints third-party HTTP chatter over its progress
  spinner.** `httpx`, `openai`, and Azure SDK `INFO` records were interleaving
  with the spinner; a handler-level filter now drops sub-warning records from
  those libraries regardless of which dependency re-enables their log level.
- **Continuous evaluation is reported once instead of twice.**
  `opex.release.no_continuous_eval` duplicated
  `safety.config.continuous_eval_missing` for the same condition. The
  operational-excellence copy was removed; the responsible-AI finding remains the
  single owner.
- **The `agentops init` target menu no longer hides hosted-agent versioning.**
  Option 2 showed only `.../agents/<name>`, implying a pinned revision was not
  supported. The menu now shows `.../agents/<name>[/versions/<v>]` and states
  that an unpinned URL evaluates whatever is currently deployed, while
  `execution: cloud` requires the explicit version that `agentops eval run`
  already enforces.
- **Hosted Foundry agent URLs are no longer misclassified as portal URLs.**
  `classify_agent_url_problem` treated every `*.services.ai.azure.com` host as an
  `ai.azure.com` portal link and rejected valid hosted endpoints.
- **`agent_override` is honoured when resolving the execution backend.**
  `_resolve_execution_backend` ignored the override, so a per-environment agent
  could be evaluated against the wrong backend.
- **Undefined Cockpit CSS variables.** The Cockpit referenced `var(--accent)` and
  `var(--fg)` without ever defining them, and its loading splash used drifted
  token values that caused a visible colour flash on load. The local Cockpit now
  consumes the shared token block consistently.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- **The Cockpit can allocate operator-declared billed totals across observed
  agents, tools, and runs.** The optional `AGENTOPS_COST_MODEL` configuration
  uses bounded read-only telemetry, exact minor-unit reconciliation, explicit
  method/confidence/provenance, separate currencies, and truthful unattributed,
  unallocated, omitted, missing, and partial states. Agent, tool, and run
  breakdowns are alternative views of the same pools, not additive.
- **Observe can attribute usage and existing allocated cost to users and
  departments.** Opt-in mappings use eligible authenticated telemetry identities,
  delegated individual views, explicit coverage states, bounded results, and
  rotation-safe opaque filters.

### Security
- **Cost allocation adds no billing or write access.** AgentOps never calls a
  billing API, infers prices or credits, or expands the hosted Cockpit's existing
  `Reader` and `Log Analytics Reader` roles. The deployment preview propagates
  only a validated, bounded, non-secret cost model when configured.
- **Attribution preserves the existing least-privilege deployment boundary.**
  Raw identities, mappings, user rows, group IDs, and filter tokens stay out of
  Doctor and release evidence; individual access reuses delegated Azure Monitor
  permissions without adding Graph, directory, secret, or write access.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **The Cockpit Models view exposes bounded granular token usage without
  overstating telemetry coverage.** Model rows show normalized cache-read,
  cache-write, and reasoning classes, preserve explicit zero versus missing
  values, and flag partial reporting both on affected rows and in the coverage
  panel. Up to five additional `gen_ai.usage.*` classes are retained in sorted
  order under their source names, with a visible signal when more were
  truncated.

### Changed
- **Breaking: Observe replaces coarse agent `source_kind` values with refined
  runtime attribution.**

  | Old value | New value(s) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `foundry` | `foundry_hosted` or `foundry_prompt` |
  | `external` | `external_registered` or `external_unregistered` |
  | — | `copilot_studio` (new) |
  | `unknown` | `unknown` |

  There is no dual-emission window, so consumers must accept the new values in
  this release.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **The Cockpit can be deployed as an authenticated, read-only Azure App
  Service.** `agentops cockpit deploy` defaults to the current workspace
  Foundry project, requires an infrastructure/RBAC/federation preview before
  mutation, reuses an existing single-tenant app registration, and preserves a
  recovery journal for safe reruns after partial failures.
- **Observe can aggregate multiple Foundry resources and projects with truthful
  source attribution and coverage.** Shared filters drive Overview, Agents,
  Models and usage, and Telemetry coverage views while bounded queries preserve
  partial results and distinguish missing evidence from numeric zero.

### Security
- **Aggregate telemetry and protected generative-AI content use separate
  identities.** The hosted UAMI receives only Reader and Log Analytics Reader;
  explicit `AppGenAIContent` reads use the signed-in user's delegated Azure
  Monitor permission through OBO, return `no-store`, and never enter shared
  caches, URLs, browser persistence, telemetry, diagnostics, or deployment
  artifacts.

### Fixed
- **Hosted Cockpit deployment preview now works with Windows Azure CLI shims
  and the live App Service name API.** Command execution resolves wrappers such
  as `az.cmd`, and hostname checks use the active subscription's documented
  `Site` availability contract before any Azure mutation.
- **Hosted Cockpit delegated consent now targets the Log Analytics API.**
  Deployment preflight resolves the `Data.Read` scope from the correct resource
  application, allowing tenant administrators to grant the required permission.
- **Developer installs include the hosted Cockpit test dependencies.** The
  standard development environment can collect and run the FastAPI integration
  tests used by CI.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Evaluations can load JSONL datasets directly from Azure Blob Storage and
  ADLS Gen2.** The existing scalar `dataset` setting accepts canonical Blob and
  DFS HTTPS object URLs. AgentOps resolves one read-only snapshot of up to
  100 MiB for local, cloud, official-evaluation, and readiness-analysis flows
  while preserving the original source URI in reports and lineage.

### Security
- **Remote datasets use only the Azure identity already running AgentOps.**
  Local runs reuse `az login`; automated runs reuse their federated, workload,
  managed, or service-principal identity. SAS URLs, dataset-specific tokens,
  account keys, connection strings, query strings, and embedded credentials are
  rejected. The identity needs `Storage Blob Data Reader` and any applicable
  ADLS path ACLs.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- **The AgentOps Cockpit now focuses on five release-readiness sections.**
  The page renders only the readiness and Doctor ship verdicts, Foundry and
  GitHub connections, the 13-item observability checklist, the latest Doctor
  findings, and prioritized next actions. Date-window and auto-refresh controls
  were removed because the remaining sections describe current configuration
  and the latest analysis rather than time-series dashboards.
- **Observability readiness now distinguishes native Foundry tracing from
  optional custom spans.** Hosted agents and prompt agents are recognized as
  natively instrumented, while repository OpenTelemetry spans are reported as
  optional extensions. App Insights linkage, rubric evaluators, alert
  definitions, and tracing evidence are resolved independently so unknown state
  is no longer presented as a failure.

### Fixed
- **Project-managed Application Insights connections now work throughout
  Doctor and Cockpit.** AgentOps discovers the attached Application Insights
  ARM resource from credential-free Foundry connection metadata and queries it
  with `LogsQueryClient.query_resource`, avoiding false missing-telemetry
  findings when no API-key connection string exists.
- **`agentops agent register` now derives hosted-agent names from Foundry
  target URLs.** A command that supplies only `--sponsor` correctly resolves
  names such as `helpdeskbot`, matching the fallback promised by `--help`.

### Removed
- **The experimental AgentOps telemetry import and custom Operations Dashboard
  have been removed.** The public telemetry command group, Log Analytics
  workbook deployment, bundled workbook/KQL assets, and dashboard-specific
  posture rule are no longer shipped while native product observability support
  is reviewed.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Pre-flight now validates Foundry project reachability independently from
  Application Insights credential discovery.** Projects whose attached
  Application Insights connection uses `ProjectManagedIdentity` no longer
  produce a false Foundry warning or require API Key credentials, while an
  explicit `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` still takes precedence.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Agents can now carry a first-class Microsoft Entra identity that travels
  from registration through traces into release evidence.** Before this, a
  trace could tell you what an agent did but not which registered agent did it,
  so nothing in the evidence pack tied runtime behaviour back to an accountable
  owner in the tenant. Three pieces close that loop. `agentops agent register`
  creates or adopts an agent identity blueprint in Microsoft Entra (idempotent,
  sponsor required, `--dry-run` supported) and records the resolved id under
  `.agentops/identity/agent-identity.json`. AgentOps then stamps that id on
  every span it emits as the OpenTelemetry resource attribute
  `gen_ai.agent.id`, omitting the attribute entirely when no identity is
  registered so presence is a meaningful filter. Finally, the release evidence
  pack publishes an `agent_identity` section reporting the id and its source.
  A read-only Doctor check reports registration posture, contacting Microsoft
  Graph only when `identity.verify` is enabled in `agentops.yaml`. `agentops.yaml`
  accepts a new optional `identity` block (`display_name`, `sponsor`, `verify`).

### Fixed
- **The official evaluation runner now honours the agent version override.**
  `prepare_official_eval` read the agent name and version straight from
  `agentops.yaml` and ignored both the `--agent` flag and the
  `AGENTOPS_AGENT` environment variable, so a pipeline that pinned a
  specific agent version still evaluated whatever version the config
  happened to carry. The override is now resolved in one place
  (`resolve_agent_override`), applied by `official_eval.py`, and forwarded
  by the generated GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps workflows. An
  unexpanded CI token such as `$(AGENTOPS_AGENT)` is treated as absent
  instead of being parsed as an agent name.

### Changed
- **The release cut logic moved out of `cut-release.yml` and into
  `scripts/check_changelog.py cut`.** The workflow used to carry the
  transformation as an inline Python heredoc, which no test could import,
  so a regression in it was only visible when a release was already being
  cut. That is exactly how the 0.8.6 cut broke. The same code now backs
  both the workflow and the unit tests, and the subcommand is idempotent:
  re-running it for a version already present in the file is a no-op.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **CI now fails a pull request that changes shipped code without a CHANGELOG
  entry.** `cut-release.yml` never generates changelog content. It inserts a
  `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>` heading beneath `## [Unreleased]` and stops there, so a
  release cycle where no PR wrote anything under `[Unreleased]` publishes an
  empty section with a green pipeline. Releases 0.8.4 and 0.8.5 both shipped
  that way and were backfilled by hand, between them hiding six user-visible
  bug fixes and six dependency bumps.

  A new `changelog` job runs `scripts/check_changelog.py` on every PR to
  `develop`. It asks for an entry only when the diff touches a file that ships
  and the PR title reads as user-visible (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `revert`, a
  breaking-change marker, or no conventional-commit type at all). Changes
  confined to `docs/`, `tests/`, `.github/workflows/`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`,
  or the top-level markdown files are never asked for one, and neither are PRs
  typed `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`,
  `chore:`, `build:`, `style:`, or `refactor:`. The check resolves each added
  line to the section it lands in, so a bullet written under an already-released
  heading fails the same as no bullet, which matches what `cut-release` will
  actually promote. Apply the `no-changelog` label to bypass it. Dependabot is
  exempt because a bot cannot respond to a red check.

  The same script guards the release itself. `cut-release.yml` and both local
  `cut-release` scripts now abort before creating the release branch when
  `[Unreleased]` is empty, so a cycle that wrote nothing at all cannot reach a
  published tag. That is a non-emptiness check, not per-change coverage: one
  bullet from any PR satisfies it.

- **Both local `cut-release` scripts inserted the new version heading in the
  wrong place.** `scripts/cut-release.sh` and `scripts/cut-release.ps1` anchored
  the insertion on the "adheres to [Semantic Versioning]" line, which sits
  *above* `## [Unreleased]`. Cutting a release locally therefore produced an
  empty `## [X.Y.Z]` section and left every accumulated entry stranded under
  `[Unreleased]`, where the next cycle would silently absorb it. Both scripts now
  anchor on `## [Unreleased]` and insert beneath it, matching what
  `cut-release.yml` has always done, and both abort if that heading is missing.

- **`agentops eval run` accepts an explicit agent target.** The eval target was
  only ever read from `agentops.yaml`, so retargeting a run meant editing
  tracked config. `--agent` now overrides it, falling back to the
  `AGENTOPS_AGENT` environment variable when the flag is absent. A bare number
  (`--agent 12`) replaces just the version segment of the configured target; a
  full agent reference (endpoint URL, `name:version`, or `model:<deployment>`)
  replaces the target outright. Unset means unchanged, so every existing run
  behaves exactly as before.

  `RunOptions.agent_override` already existed in the orchestrator and was
  already consumed by all three execution backends, but nothing set it. This
  connects the CLI to that seam and forwards `AGENTOPS_AGENT` into every
  generated eval step on GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps, so a future pipeline
  change can retarget the gate without rewriting `agentops.yaml` mid-run.
  Nothing in the shipped pipelines assigns a value yet, and the injected
  expressions read same-job scope, which cannot see a prior job's output.
  Wiring a producer needs declared job outputs on GitHub Actions or
  `stageDependencies` on Azure DevOps; see issue #388.

  Azure DevOps leaves `$(NAME)` in the environment verbatim when a variable is
  undefined, so an unexpanded token is treated as "no override" rather than as
  an agent expression. An empty or unexpanded value falls back to the
  configured agent instead of failing, because every pipeline generated today
  passes exactly that.

  `agentops workflow analyze` reports the pinned agent version as a signal when
  the repo also has a generated deploy pipeline, which is the only place a
  later deploy step could move the target underneath the gate. Eval-only repos
  see nothing.

### Fixed
- **The eval gate installed `azd` but never gave it credentials, on both GitHub
  Actions and Azure DevOps.** When a project uses the azd evaluation backend,
  the generated pipeline runs `agentops eval run`, which shells out to
  `azd ai agent eval run`. Both platforms installed the pinned
  `azure.ai.agents` extension and then invoked the binary with no credentials,
  so the eval gate failed before reaching Foundry.

  This is the issue #379 trap in a job nobody had exercised. The fix differs by
  platform because the surrounding authentication differs. On Azure DevOps
  every azd call runs inside `AzureCLI@2`, which completes the
  service-connection handshake and leaves the Azure CLI authenticated, but
  `azd` keeps a separate credential store and ignores that session unless
  `auth.useAzCliAuth` is set; the eval stage now sets it, matching the provision
  and deploy stages in the same pipeline. On GitHub Actions `azure/login@v3`
  authenticates only the Azure CLI, so the eval job now runs
  `azd auth login --federated-credential-provider github` with the same
  `vars.AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `vars.AZURE_TENANT_ID` the provision and deploy
  jobs already use. Every generated job that installs the azd extension now
  also authenticates it.

- **The generated Azure DevOps PR pipeline was not valid YAML.** The
  report-comment step embedded a multi-line `python -c` snippet whose
  continuation lines started at column 0. A column-0 line terminates the
  surrounding `bash: |` block scalar, so Azure DevOps rejected the file with a
  parse error before running anything. The continuation lines are now indented
  into the block; the trailing backslashes still join them into a single
  logical line, so the Python behaviour is unchanged. A regression test parses
  every generated ADO pipeline across all eval-runner variants and rejects any
  stray column-0 line.

- **Publishing a release never rebuilt the documentation site.** The site is
  built from the `docs` branch, and the `Deploy Documentation` workflow that
  builds it declares a `release: published` trigger. That trigger could never
  fire, because the workflow file existed only on `docs`, and GitHub Actions
  resolves workflows for non-`push` events from the default branch. Four
  consecutive releases published while the home page kept advertising `v0.8.1`,
  since the version string is baked into the HTML at build time. The workflow
  now also lives on the default branch so release events can reach it. It still
  checks out `docs` explicitly, so the published content is unchanged, and
  `push` events continue to resolve from the pushed commit, so there is no
  duplicate run.

- **The contributor setup command in `how-it-works.md` installed nothing.** It
  suggested `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, but `dev` is a PEP 735 dependency group
  rather than an extra, so pip warned about an unknown extra and skipped every
  development dependency. The next documented step, running pytest, then failed
  on a missing module. The page now uses `uv sync --group dev`, which is what
  all eleven CI invocations already use.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Generated `azd` workflows failed at the provision and deploy steps.** Every
  `azd`-based CI template ran `azd provision` and `azd deploy` without first
  installing the `azure.ai.agents` extension and without authenticating the
  `azd` CLI itself, so the provision job stopped with
  `ERROR: Auto-installation is not supported in CI/CD environments.`

  Two separate gaps caused this. First, `azd` refuses to auto-install
  extensions in CI, so the extension has to be installed explicitly. Second,
  `azure/login@v3` authenticates the Azure CLI, not `azd`; `azd` keeps its own
  credential store and needs its own `azd auth login --federated-credential-provider github`.
  The `eval` job was unaffected and passed, which made the failure look
  intermittent: `agentops` itself uses `azure-identity`, which happily reads
  the Azure CLI session, so only the jobs that shell out to the `azd` binary
  broke.

  Both steps are now emitted into the provision and deploy jobs of every
  `azd` template, on GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps alike. The extension
  version is read from the same source the CLI uses rather than hardcoded, so
  it cannot drift.

- **`execution: cloud` still emitted `azd` setup into the eval job.** With
  cloud execution the evaluation runs server-side in Foundry and never invokes
  `azd`, but the generated workflow installed and authenticated it anyway.
  That is dead setup work on every run, and it made the eval job fail for a
  reason unrelated to evaluation whenever `azd` auth was not configured.
  `workflow analyze` and the eval-runner recommendation now both take the
  configured execution mode into account.

- **Generated workflows installed a package extra that does not exist.**
  Templates and two tutorials asked for `agentops-accelerator[foundry,agent]`.
  There is no `foundry` extra; the real ones are `mcp` and `agent`. Corrected
  in 10 GitHub Actions templates, 8 Azure DevOps templates, and the tutorials.

- **The eval job ignored the deployment environment.** Dev and QA workflows
  declared `environment:` on provision and deploy but not on eval, so the eval
  job could not read the environment-scoped variables it needs and fell back
  to whatever happened to be set at repository scope. The production
  `safety-eval` job intentionally keeps no `environment:`, because gating it
  would force a human to approve the run before seeing any results.

- **`eval analyze` labelled agent targets as `model quality`.** The scenario
  hint inspected only dataset column names, so any dataset carrying an
  `expected` column was reported as a model-quality scenario. That is correct
  for a raw `model:<deployment>` target compared against a reference answer,
  but wrong for an agent answering `input` with a free-form reply, which is
  conversational. Foundry hosted *and* prompt agents were both affected. The
  hint now agrees with `core/evaluators.py`, which already branched on the
  target kind when picking the actual evaluators. `--format text` also leaked
  the raw kind string (`Project: foundry_hosted evaluation setup`); both
  renderers now share one label table so they cannot drift apart again.

- **`workflow analyze` hardcoded "Foundry prompt agent" as the target.** The
  Foundry eval checklist printed that label regardless of the real target, so
  a hosted-agent project was told it had a prompt agent. The rows now render
  the reasons the analysis actually produced.

### Changed
- **OIDC docs now cover `sub_claim_prefix`.** Accounts configured with an
  immutable-ID subject claim receive a subject built from numeric account and
  repository IDs rather than the plain names, so a federated credential
  matching only `repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<env>` is never matched and
  the workflow fails with `AADSTS700213`. The setup guide now explains how to
  read the prefix from
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/oidc/customization/sub` and register the
  second credential. Note that the `use_default` and `use_immutable_subject`
  booleans in that response are not reliable indicators; read the
  `sub_claim_prefix` string itself.
- **Release documentation corrected.** `docs/release-process.md` and the
  release-management skill described a manual approval gate protecting the
  PyPI publish that does not exist: both environments have empty
  `protection_rules`, so pushing the tag publishes immediately and
  irreversibly. The same files also documented `VSCE_PAT` as an environment
  secret when it is a repository secret. The `main` → `develop` sync step,
  previously easy to skip, is now called out explicitly.

### Dependencies
- `mcp` 1.27.1 → 1.28.1, with the floor raised to `mcp>=1.28.1,<2`. The
  proposed `<3` widening was rejected: `mcp` 2.0.0 renames `FastMCP` to
  `MCPServer` and is a breaking rewrite. CI reported green on that change only
  because `uv sync --group dev` never installs the `mcp` extra, so the MCP
  tests skip.
- `cryptography` 48.0.1 → 50.0.0. The breaking changes in 49 and 50 concern
  FFDH deprecation and stricter DER/SCT/OCSP/CRL/PKCS#7 parsing; the only
  direct consumer, `agent/server/auth.py`, is EC-only over a PEM public key.
- `aiohttp` 3.14.1 → 3.14.3, `nltk` 3.9.4 → 3.10.0,
  `actions/setup-node` 6 → 7, `actions/setup-python` 6 → 7.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Generated CI pinned an `azd` extension version that was never published.**
  The templates asked for `azure.ai.agents` version `1.0.0`, which does not
  exist in the azd extension registry, so every generated pipeline targeting a
  Foundry hosted agent stopped at `Install pinned azd AI agents extension`
  with `ERROR: no extensions found`, on both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.
  Pinned to `1.0.0-beta.9`, the highest version actually published.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **`execution: cloud` now works with a Foundry hosted agent.** Setting
  `execution: cloud` on a hosted agent endpoint failed with
  `execution: cloud only supports Foundry prompt agents`, so hosted-agent users
  had no way to run a server-side evaluation and see the results in the New
  Foundry Evaluations panel. Their only option was `execution: local`, which
  keeps everything on the client and publishes nothing.

  This was an artificial restriction, not an API limit. The Foundry Evals API
  identifies its target with `{"type": "azure_ai_agent", "name": ..., "version":
  ...}`, and a hosted agent URL already carries both values in its path
  (`/agents/<name>/versions/<version>`). The problem was that `classify_agent()`
  never extracted them: it returned a `foundry_hosted` target with `name` and
  `version` left as `None`, so the cloud path had nothing to send and rejected
  the target up front.

  `classify_agent()` now parses the agent name and version out of a hosted
  endpoint URL, tolerating trailing path segments (`/responses`), query strings,
  and fragments. The guards in `pipeline/cloud_runner.py` and
  `pipeline/orchestrator.py` accept `foundry_hosted` alongside `foundry_prompt`.
  A hosted URL with no `/versions/<version>` segment is still rejected, because
  there is no version to pin the run to, but the error now names the missing
  segment instead of rejecting the whole target kind.

  `execution: local` remains the default for every target kind, so this change
  adds an option without altering existing behavior.

- **CI: `Install from TestPyPI` no longer fails on a healthy build.** After a
  dev, staging, or release build uploaded a distribution to TestPyPI and
  received `200 OK`, the verification step immediately tried to install it and
  gave up after 5 attempts spaced 30 s apart (~2 min). TestPyPI serves its
  simple index through a CDN, so propagation regularly takes longer than that,
  and the job failed with
  `No matching distribution found for agentops-accelerator==<version>` for a
  package that had in fact been published successfully. The retry window is now
  12 attempts (~6 min), and `pip install` runs with `--no-cache-dir` so a
  negative index response from an earlier attempt is not reused within the same
  job. Applied to `ci.yml` (`verify-dev`), `staging.yml`, and `release.yml` —
  in `release.yml` this step gates publication to PyPI, so a false negative
  there blocked the release entirely.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **`protocol: responses` now works against a Foundry hosted agent.** Every
  invocation failed with
  `HTTP 400 ... Missing required query parameter: api-version`, because the
  hosted-agent path built the request URL by string-concatenating `/responses`
  onto the configured URL. That had three consequences:
  - Any existing query string was corrupted, because `/responses` was appended
    after it (`.../responses?api-version=v1` became
    `.../responses?api-version=v1/responses`).
  - The required `api-version` query parameter was never added, so the Foundry
    data plane rejected the request outright.
  - A Foundry *agent identity* URL
    (`/api/projects/<project>/agents/<name>/versions/<n>`) was accepted even
    though it is not an invocable route; the invocable route is
    `/agents/<name>/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses`.

  The URL is now parsed rather than concatenated: the path and the query string
  are handled separately, an agent identity URL is normalized onto the protocol
  route, and `api-version` defaults to `v1` for Foundry protocol routes only.
  When the configured URL pins a version, the version is preserved by sending an
  `agent_reference` in the request body (the same mechanism
  `_invoke_foundry_prompt` already uses), so pinning semantics are not lost.
  URLs that already point at a `/responses` route and non-Foundry HTTP endpoints
  are left untouched.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **`agentops doctor` no longer prints noisy non-fatal errors to the console.**
  Three low-level probes that already degrade gracefully were leaking their
  transport errors to the screen during readiness checks:
  - The **LLM judge** called the Foundry project OpenAI client on the legacy
    `/openai/` route, which returns HTTP 404 for chat completions, printing
    `WARNING: llm_assist: judge call failed: Error code: 404`. The client is now
    normalized to the stable `/openai/v1/` route (with the injected
    `api-version` query parameter cleared) using the same reused credential and
    token refresh, so the judge runs instead of 404ing. Non-Foundry endpoints
    are left untouched.
  - The **OpenAI data-plane RBAC check** built an ARM role-assignment filter
    (`atScopeAndAbove() and assignedTo('<oid>')`) that ARM rejects with
    `UnsupportedQuery`. It now sends the supported `assignedTo('<oid>')` filter,
    which already returns assignments at the target scope and every ancestor
    scope, so the check runs instead of skipping with a console error.
  - The **Application Insights** REST probe caught only `urllib.error.URLError`,
    so a read timeout (a `socket.timeout`, which is an `OSError` but not a
    `URLError`) escaped and surfaced
    `INFO: Rate-limit App Insights probe failed (non-fatal): The read operation
    timed out`. It now catches `OSError` (covering both) and the request timeout
    was raised from 10s to 30s, so a slow App Insights degrades quietly.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Add a read-only **Agent behavior** tab to the Foundry operations Azure Monitor
  workbook, with versioned `AppEvents` / `customEvents` normalization, explicit
  data and freshness states, separate invocation / evaluated-trace /
  evaluation-event counts, scale-safe per-evaluator trends, and trace IDs for
  Foundry investigation. Human trace annotations are the documented
  `gen_ai.evaluation.result` producer; automated trace-evaluation event export
  remains validation-dependent.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **`agentops telemetry dashboard deploy` now works.** The generated ARM
  template set the workbook `location` to `global`, which
  `Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` rejects
  (`LocationNotAvailableForResourceType`), so the v0.7.0 deploy always failed.
  The workbook now deploys to the target resource group's region
  (`[resourceGroup().location]`) by default; an explicit region override is
  still honored. Verified with a live deploy against Azure.

### Security
- Bumped `idna` to `3.18` and `pytest` to `9.1.1` in `uv.lock` to clear two
  moderate Dependabot alerts. The high-severity `nltk` advisory
  (GHSA-p4gq-832x-fm9v) has no upstream fix yet and remains open until a
  patched release is available.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Foundry operations dashboard.** A new Azure Monitor Workbook
  (`agentops telemetry dashboard`) surfaces Azure OpenAI capacity (PTU
  utilization, rate-limit, spillover), traffic and tokens, latency
  percentiles (TTFT, TBT, TTLT, tokens/sec), and errors and throttling for a
  given Azure OpenAI resource and Log Analytics workspace. The workbook JSON,
  its per-metric KQL queries, and an authoring README ship as package data.
  Three commands manage it: `deploy` (RBAC + diagnostic-settings preflight,
  then deploy the `Microsoft.Insights/workbooks` ARM resource, with
  `--dry-run` to emit the template), `open` (build the portal deep link and
  open a browser, `--print-url` for non-interactive shells), and `export`
  (copy the packaged workbook JSON to a local path). `agentops telemetry
  dashboard deploy` is the first CLI command that creates an Azure resource;
  it is scoped to a single workbook.
- **Doctor check for Azure OpenAI usage telemetry.** A new WAF-AI Operational
  Excellence posture rule (`waf.observability.aoai_diagnostic_categories`)
  warns when the Azure OpenAI account is not emitting the `RequestResponse`
  and `AzureOpenAIRequestUsage` diagnostic log categories to a Log Analytics
  workspace, and prints the exact `az monitor diagnostic-settings create`
  fix. Doctor stays read-only.

### Changed
- **Cockpit redesign answers "can I ship?" first.** The Cockpit now opens with
  three consolidated status cards (Readiness, Doctor, Eval gate) that expand
  their detail sections on click, promotes "Next actions" to second position,
  and collapses the detailed sections by default. The former "Eval gate
  summary" and "Quality gate summary" are merged into a single "Eval gates"
  section with two subgroups. The Foundry launchpad footer adds a "Foundry
  operations dashboard" tile (the same workbook portal URL used by
  `agentops telemetry dashboard open`) next to "Operate overview", folds the
  single-tile "Azure Monitor" group into the Foundry project group, and
  removes the duplicated App Insights CTA from the Production signal section.
  Cockpit remains read-only.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Retrieval telemetry can now be imported as evaluation datasets.** The new
  `telemetry_imports` config contract and `agentops telemetry validate`,
  `agentops telemetry preview`, and `agentops telemetry import` commands let
  teams turn reviewed retrieval telemetry into dataset-backed eval rows with
  `response_source: dataset`. Grey-box HTTP agents can map `response_fields` from
  `$response.context`, and the evaluation docs now cover the import workflow and
  contract.

### Changed
- Updated the AgentOps CLI tagline to use `Operate` instead of `Own` for clearer
  operator-focused positioning.
- **Prompt-agent PR validation now uses sandbox instead of dev.** Generated
  GitHub and Azure DevOps PR workflows stage prompt-agent candidates in the
  sandbox Foundry environment, keeping dev for deployed-of-record versions.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **VS Code extension is back on the Marketplace.** The 0.5.2 release published to
  PyPI, but the Marketplace (VSIX) publish was blocked by an expired publisher
  token, so the VS Code extension never updated to 0.5.2. Release 0.5.3 ships the
  same toolkit as 0.5.2 with a refreshed Marketplace credential, so
  `agentops-accelerator` on PyPI and the AgentOps extension on the Marketplace are
  back in sync. No functional changes to the CLI or the extension.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Per-evaluator input remapping via `evaluators[].input_mapping`.** Evaluator
  overrides in `agentops.yaml` now accept an optional `input_mapping` map that is
  merged onto the preset's default inputs, so you only list the keys you want to
  change. This is what lets a grey-box HTTP/JSON target point a RAG evaluator at
  the live retrieved context captured by `response_fields`, for example
  `context: $response.context` on `GroundednessEvaluator` and
  `RetrievalEvaluator`. The mapping applies to both explicitly listed overrides
  and auto-selected presets. A bare evaluator name string (`- GroundednessEvaluator`)
  is still accepted as shorthand for `{ name: GroundednessEvaluator }`, so
  existing configs are unchanged.



### Added
- **Rendered gate results in GitHub Actions job summaries.** When AgentOps runs
  inside GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` set), `agentops eval run` now
  appends the full rendered `report.md` to the workflow run summary, and
  `agentops assert run` / `agentops redteam run` append a concise pass/fail
  summary (suite, cases, pass rate, per-dimension and per-risk-category
  breakdowns). Reviewers can read the report directly on the run page without
  downloading the uploaded artifacts. Writes are best-effort and a no-op outside
  GitHub Actions, so local runs are unaffected.

### Changed
- **Generated workflows use Node24-ready action versions.** The prompt-agent and
  watchdog workflow templates now pin `actions/download-artifact@v7` (instead of
  the Node20 `@v4`), so generated pipelines no longer emit the "Node.js 20
  actions are deprecated" warning. A regression guard checks every workflow
  template against the known Node20 action majors.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Grey-box retrieval capture for HTTP JSON targets.** An HTTP target can now
  capture extra named fields from a JSON response via a `response_fields` map
  (`name -> dot-path`). Captured values are exposed to evaluator `input_mapping`
  as `$response.<name>` (for example `$response.context`,
  `$response.retrieved_documents`), and dataset columns can be referenced with
  `$row.<name>` (for example `$row.qrels`). This lets RAG evaluators such as
  Groundedness, Retrieval, and Document Retrieval score the retrieval actually
  used at eval time instead of static dataset context. The primary prediction
  (`response_field`) and single-field behavior are unchanged when
  `response_fields` is not set.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Governance gates for HTTP agents (ASSERT and Red Team).** `agentops assert
  run` and `agentops redteam run` now work against a live HTTP orchestrator
  endpoint, not only model/deployment targets. Red Team wraps the HTTP endpoint
  as an SDK-compatible target and reuses the AgentOps HTTP mapping
  (`request_field`, `response_mode`, `stream`, custom headers). ASSERT resolves
  `assert-ai` inside the active virtual environment, accepts non-secret values
  from `assert.env`, can request an AAD token from the Azure CLI for local
  auth-disabled Azure AI resources, injects the GPT-5 `max_completion_tokens`
  shim only when configured, and materializes a runtime ASSERT config so
  committed configs no longer need absolute artifact paths.
- **Generated workflows run the ASSERT and Red Team gates.** `agentops workflow
  generate` now installs the optional ASSERT/Red Team dependencies, runs those
  gates when `assert:` or `redteam:` is present in `agentops.yaml`, uploads
  their artifacts, and emits the corrected Red Team command quoting.

### Fixed
- **Reasoning-model judges no longer fail the eval gate in CI.** The generated
  GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps eval and Red Team steps now forward
  `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`, so AgentOps detects reasoning models (such as
  `gpt-5-nano`) and uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`. This
  removes the judge `400` error that could break the eval gate when the judge
  deployment is a reasoning model.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Streaming HTTP targets.** The `http_json` target now understands streaming
  responses so AgentOps can evaluate SSE/streaming agents (such as the
  gpt-rag-orchestrator `/orchestrator` endpoint) directly, without a manual
  adapter. A new `response_mode: json|sse|text` field selects the response
  parser (`json` is the default and preserves the existing single-`json.loads`
  behavior exactly). For `sse`/`text`, an optional `stream` block configures
  aggregation: `text_field` (dotted path to the token text when each SSE
  `data:` line is JSON), `done_marker` (stop token, e.g. `[DONE]`), and
  `strip_leading_token` (drop the leading whitespace-delimited token, e.g. the
  orchestrator's `conversation_id` prefix). The auth header is now configurable
  via `auth_header_name` (default `Authorization`) and `auth_value_template`
  (default `Bearer {token}`, where `{token}` is replaced by the
  `auth_header_env` value), so targets gated by a shared secret such as
  `X-API-KEY` are supported without hardcoding the secret in `agentops.yaml`.
  Streaming uses the same stdlib (`urllib`) transport and 3-try backoff as the
  JSON path. When a JSON parse fails on a `text/event-stream` response, the
  error now suggests setting `response_mode: sse|text`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Prompt-agent tutorials no longer require manual portal copy/paste.**
  `agentops prompt pull` reads the configured Foundry prompt agent
  (`agent: name:version`), validates that the Foundry definition is actually a
  prompt agent, and writes the reviewed Sandbox instructions to
  `.agentops/prompts/<agent-name>.prompt.md` by default. Before writing, the CLI
  prints the resolved agent, endpoint, endpoint source, and destination file so
  operators can catch the wrong environment early. Changed prompt files are
  protected by default and require `--force` to overwrite reviewed local edits.
  The command updates `prompt_file` in `agentops.yaml` unless
  `--no-update-config` is passed, and it can resolve the endpoint from
  `--project-endpoint`, `agentops.yaml`, `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, or
  the active `.azure/<env>/.env`. The prompt-agent tutorial and packaged
  `agentops-eval` skill now use this command instead of a manual here-string.
  ([#322](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/issues/322))

### Changed
- **`agentops eval init` now recommends evaluators from the agent and dataset
  shape.** The azd bootstrap path now reuses the same AgentOps evaluator
  catalog as `agentops eval run`: free-form answer datasets get answer-quality
  checks, RAG-shaped datasets get groundedness / relevance / retrieval checks,
  and tool-use datasets get tool-call / intent / task-adherence checks while
  avoiding literal-answer similarity metrics. Explicit `evaluators:` entries in
  `agentops.yaml` still win. The CLI prints the recommendation source, detected
  signals, and selected azd built-ins before reporting the generated
  `eval.yaml`, so users can see why those evaluators were chosen.
  ([#323](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/issues/323))

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **`agentops eval init` now works with both old and new `azure.ai.agents` azd
  extensions.** Version 0.1.40 of the extension renamed the eval subcommand from
  `azd ai agent eval init` to `azd ai agent eval generate`, which made
  `agentops eval init` hard-fail with `Command "init" is deprecated, use 'azd ai
  agent eval generate' instead`. AgentOps now invokes `generate` first and
  transparently falls back to the legacy `init` subcommand when an older
  extension does not recognise `generate`. The fallback only triggers on
  subcommand-name/deprecation errors; genuine failures (authentication, project
  endpoint, timeouts) are still surfaced immediately and unchanged. All
  previously passed flags (`--project-endpoint`, `--agent`,
  `--gen-instruction-file`, `--eval-model`, `--dataset`, `--evaluator`) and the
  recipe discovery/persistence behaviour are preserved.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- **PR-stage Foundry prompt-agent versions are now tagged at the source.** When
  `agentops.pipeline.prompt_deploy stage` runs in a PR context (GitHub Actions
  `pull_request` event or Azure DevOps `BUILD_REASON=PullRequest`), the version
  it creates in the dev Foundry project carries metadata
  `agentops:candidate=true`, `agentops:pr=<number>`, and
  `agentops:created_at=<ISO timestamp>`. Portal viewers can filter the
  Versions tab on `agentops:candidate` to separate abandoned PR candidates
  from deployed-of-record versions, and downstream consumers that resolve
  "latest" can refuse to pick up candidates. Deployed-of-record versions
  (push to `main`/`develop`/`release/**` or `workflow_dispatch`) are not
  tagged, so absence of `agentops:candidate` is the deployed-of-record
  signal. The PR/deploy workflow templates and the prompt-agent quickstart
  tutorial are updated to describe the new contract.
  ([#214](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/issues/214))

### Fixed
- **Clean installs now include the pager dependency used by explain commands.**
  `agentops explain`, `agentops init explain`, and `agentops doctor explain`
  import Click directly to render long manual output, so `click>=8.1,<9` is now
  declared as a runtime dependency instead of relying on transitive installs.

- **`agentops eval init` now works with both old and new `azure.ai.agents` azd
  extensions.** Version 0.1.40 of the extension renamed the eval subcommand from
  `azd ai agent eval init` to `azd ai agent eval generate`, which made
  `agentops eval init` hard-fail with `Command "init" is deprecated, use 'azd ai
  agent eval generate' instead`. AgentOps now invokes `generate` first and
  transparently falls back to the legacy `init` subcommand when an older
  extension does not recognise `generate`. The fallback only triggers on
  subcommand-name/deprecation errors; genuine failures (authentication, project
  endpoint, timeouts) are still surfaced immediately and unchanged. All
  previously passed flags (`--project-endpoint`, `--agent`,
  `--gen-instruction-file`, `--eval-model`, `--dataset`, `--evaluator`) and the
  recipe discovery/persistence behaviour are preserved.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **`agentops doctor` now detects missing OpenAI data-plane RBAC on the Foundry
  resource.** A new `security.missing_openai_data_plane_rbac` check resolves the
  signed-in principal (via the `oid` claim of the access token used by
  `DefaultAzureCredential`) and lists role assignments at the Foundry account
  scope using `azure-mgmt-authorization`. When none of *Cognitive Services
  OpenAI User*, *Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor* or *Cognitive Services
  Contributor* is present (directly or inherited), Doctor surfaces an
  actionable WARNING that includes the exact `az role assignment create`
  command for *Cognitive Services OpenAI User* scoped to the Foundry account.
  The check is read-only and skips silently when the SDK, principal or scope
  cannot be resolved. ([#228](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/issues/228))

### Changed
- **`agentops-pr` workflow templates now auto-detect a committed baseline.**
  Both the GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/agentops-pr.yml`) and Azure
  DevOps (`.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-pr.yml`) PR templates emitted by
  `agentops workflow generate` wrap `agentops eval run` with a small bash
  guard. When `.agentops/baseline/results.json` exists in the consumer
  repo, the step automatically passes `--baseline .agentops/baseline/results.json`;
  without the file the behaviour is unchanged. Aligns shipped templates
  with the `tutorial-baseline-comparison.md` "drop a file in your repo"
  promise. Deploy templates (`dev`/`qa`/`prod`) are untouched.
  ([#155](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/issues/155))

### Fixed
- **`agentops skills install --platform` help text now lists `cursor`.** The
  CLI option help was advertising only `copilot` and `claude` even though the
  `cursor` platform is fully implemented (registers rules in
  `.cursor/rules/agentops.mdc`). Updated to `Target platform(s): copilot,
  claude, cursor.` so users discover the supported value from `--help`.

## [0.3.23] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **`agentops-governance` skill now scaffolds a valid `assert-ai 0.1.0` config.**
  The previous skeleton invented top-level keys (`dimensions:`,
  `num_cases_per_dimension:`, `target.type:`, `suite_id:`/`run_id:`) that
  `assert-ai run` rejects with `config has unsupported field(s)`. The skill
  and tutorial step 12 now generate the real pipeline schema (`suite`/`run`/
  `behavior.preset`/`default_model`/`pipeline.{systematize,test_set,inference,
  judge}`) using the built-in `travel_planner` behavior preset shipped with
  `assert-ai`, plus a `safety-core` + `alignment` judge combo. Added a
  troubleshooting note explaining the LiteLLM-style Azure env vars
  (`AZURE_API_KEY`/`AZURE_API_BASE`/`AZURE_API_VERSION`) that `assert-ai`
  needs at runtime.

## [0.3.22] - 2026-06-12

### Security
- **E2E agent container dependencies no longer resolve vulnerable Starlette or
  mem0ai versions.** The sample FastAPI service now pins patched FastAPI and
  Agent Framework releases and adds an explicit `mem0ai` pin so Dependabot no
  longer reports the transitive Starlette host-header / file-response advisories
  or the mem0ai unsafe deserialization advisory on the default branch.

## [0.3.21] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **`agentops-workflow` skill now verifies OIDC tenant, branch upstream
  tracking, and trace-sampling RBAC before wiring CI.** The packaged skill
  instructs agents to treat `AZURE_TENANT_ID` as the tenant that owns the Entra
  app registration / federated credential (not the subscription tenant), to set
  and verify the local trunk branch upstream (`git branch -vv` must show
  `[origin/main]`), and to grant **Reader** on Application Insights (and its
  backing Log Analytics workspace) to the Foundry project managed identity for
  trace-to-dataset flows.

### Docs
- **Prompt-agent, hosted-agent, and end-to-end tutorials hardened end to end.**
  OIDC setup calls out the app-registration tenant; observability steps require
  App Insights Reader for trace sampling and cover workspace-backed App Insights;
  the telemetry step queries `gen_ai.evaluation` results from `AppEvents`
  (table-safe, no hard-coded dates); the evidence step explains expected
  production-telemetry criticals and where the Doctor thresholds live
  (`.agentops/agent.yaml`); and the Cockpit step is now a concrete walkthrough
  (exact `http://127.0.0.1:8090` URL, read-only note, per-section checks, and
  azd-env switching instead of a non-existent URL switch).

## [0.3.20] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **`agentops-governance` skill can now scaffold the ASSERT and Red Team
  runners** (install `assert-ai` / `azure-ai-evaluation[redteam]`, create
  `./assert/eval_config.yaml`, append the `assert:` / `redteam:` block to
  `agentops.yaml`). Previously the skill only drafted reviewable evidence
  skeletons.

### Fixed
- **`execution: azd` reports no longer ship empty `Dataset:` lines and empty
  `## Rows` tables.** The `eval.yaml` parser now recognizes the `dataset_file:`
  field that `azd ai agent eval init` emits, so `report.md` shows the actual
  dataset path. When azd returns aggregate metrics only (the normal case), the
  reporter omits the row tables entirely and instead emits a `## Per-row
  breakdown` section that links to the Foundry run for the per-sample view.
- **`agentops eval run` prints a clickable Foundry deep link on success.**
  After a successful azd run, the CLI now emits a `Foundry run: <url>` line
  alongside the `results.json`/`report.md` paths so users can jump straight to
  the per-sample table and rubric drill-downs in the Foundry portal.

### Changed
- **Shorter azd backend log line.** Replaced the verbose `Running azd backend:
  azd --no-prompt ai agent eval run --config <long path> --output json` line
  with a concise `Running azd backend: azd ai agent eval run`; the full
  command remains captured in the per-failure debug logs introduced in 0.3.18.
- **`execution: azd` startup line uses a workspace-relative recipe path** so
  the "delegating to azd ai agent eval" message stays readable on long
  Windows paths.

## [0.3.18] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **`agentops eval run` surfaces real azd failures instead of swallowing them
  behind a spinner line.** When `execution: azd` fails, the error now includes
  the full command, exit code, and both stderr and stdout (truncated
  defensively). Raw streams are also persisted to
  `.agentops/results/<ts>/azd_eval_run_stdout.log` and `_stderr.log` (and the
  matching `azd_eval_show_*` files when `azd ai agent eval show` fails) so the
  underlying cause is always recoverable from disk. Previously the CLI printed
  only the active azd spinner step (e.g. "Resolving eval context..."), leaving
  users with no actionable diagnostic.

## [0.3.17] - 2026-06-09

## [0.3.16] - 2026-06-09

## [0.3.15] - 2026-06-09

## [0.3.14] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **`agentops assert run` orchestrates the open-source ASSERT framework.**
  AgentOps now invokes the `assert-ai` CLI as an active CI step instead of only
  consuming pre-generated artifacts via `assert_path:`. A new `assert:` block in
  `agentops.yaml` (`config`, `results_dir`, `suite`, `run_id`,
  `fail_on_violations`) drives subprocess invocation, locates the run output
  under `<results_dir>/<suite>/<run>/`, parses `metrics.json` and
  `scores.jsonl`, and writes a normalized summary at `.agentops/assert/latest.json`
  that the release evidence pack ingests automatically. Exit code 2 when any
  policy dimension reports violations.
- **`agentops redteam run` orchestrates Foundry's AI Red Teaming agent (PyRIT).**
  AgentOps now invokes `azure.ai.evaluation.red_team.RedTeam` against the
  configured target (Azure OpenAI deployment, Foundry prompt agent, or HTTP
  endpoint) and normalizes the per-category and per-strategy attack outcomes.
  A new `redteam:` block in `agentops.yaml` (`target`, `risk_categories`,
  `attack_strategies`, `num_objectives`, `fail_on_attack_success_rate`)
  controls the scan; results land at `.agentops/redteam/latest.json` so the
  evidence pack picks them up via `redteam_path:` automatically. Exit code 2
  when attack-success-rate exceeds the configured threshold.

## [0.3.13] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Quickstart rubrics no longer block azd eval runs with placeholder evidence.**
  The Travel Agent hardening flow now defaults to multi-turn dataset coverage and
  treats rubric evaluators as advanced opt-in only after Foundry / azd emits real
  metric names, while AgentOps preserves rubric metadata without failing a normal
  azd result solely because matching rubric metrics were not emitted.

## [0.3.12] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Foundry observability readiness now spans eval, Doctor, Cockpit, and release evidence.**
  `agentops.yaml` supports `dataset_kind`, `rubrics`, and `observability`
  metadata for multi-turn coverage, rubric evaluator gates, trace sampling, and
  replay/evaluation/dataset links. Doctor and Cockpit surface the readiness
  state without mutating cloud resources, and release evidence records the same
  signals for reviewers.
- **Trace promotion preserves evaluation lineage.** `agentops eval
  promote-traces` now carries operation/span IDs, source system, agent version,
  replay/evaluation URLs, sampling policy, and multi-turn message fields into
  candidate datasets and their manifest.

### Changed
- **Rubric evaluators are executed through the azd backend.** When `rubrics:`
  is configured, `agentops eval init` includes those evaluator names in the azd
  recipe and `agentops eval run` fails closed outside `execution: azd`, so rubric
  scores cannot be treated as evidence unless Foundry / azd actually ran them.
- **Tutorials now carry rubric and observability proof into evaluation and CI/CD.**
  The Travel Agent flow keeps the existing smoke recording through step 10, then
  upgrades the gate to multi-turn dataset rows, rubric thresholds, trace
  sampling/replay lineage, and CI/CD workflows that reuse the same eval contract.

## [0.3.11] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Local AI-assisted evaluators now support reasoning-model graders.** When
  `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` points at `gpt-5*`, `o1*`, `o3*`, or `o4*`,
  AgentOps marks the Azure AI Evaluation evaluator model as reasoning-capable so
  the SDK sends `max_completion_tokens` instead of the unsupported `max_tokens`.
- **`agentops eval run` no longer hides interactive azd prompts while appearing
  to hang.** The azd backend now runs `azd ai agent eval run` and the follow-up
  `show` command with `--no-prompt` and a closed stdin, so any missing
  authentication/configuration fails visibly instead of waiting indefinitely.
- **`agentops eval init` now bootstraps the minimal azd prompt-agent context.**
  For Foundry prompt-agent configs, the command creates missing `azure.yaml` and
  `src/<agent>/agent.yaml` files, enriches the active `.azure/<env>/.env` with
  Foundry project metadata when it can resolve the project resource, and then
  generates the azd eval recipe. The prompt-agent quickstart now keeps the main
  path to `agentops eval init` followed by `agentops eval run`, while still using
  `azd ai agent eval` under the hood.
- **`agentops workflow analyze` now tells azd eval users to run
  `agentops eval init` first.** When an azd eval recipe is selected, the
  recommended commands and next steps now explicitly create or reuse the recipe
  before telling users to run the local eval gate.
- **`agentops eval run` now prints heartbeat feedback while azd is running.**
  Long `azd ai agent eval run` calls now show an immediate waiting message and
  periodic elapsed-time updates instead of leaving the terminal silent while
  Foundry completes the native evaluation.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Prompt-agent tutorial now uses `azd ai agent eval` as the standard eval
  path.** Step 10 creates the minimal azd service context, records Foundry
  project metadata in the active `.azure/<env>/.env`, runs `agentops eval init`,
  and verifies the native azd eval backend with `agentops eval run`.
- **`agentops eval init` now prepares azd-compatible inputs for prompt-agent
  datasets.** The wrapper writes an azd JSONL copy with `query` values derived
  from AgentOps `input`, passes absolute paths for azd service-project
  resolution, uses stable built-in evaluators by default, and decodes azd output
  safely on Windows.
- **AgentOps now normalizes the current azd preview eval output.** The azd
  runner reads text run IDs, exports details with `azd ai agent eval show
  --out-file`, and converts per-criteria pass counts into aggregate metrics for
  the AgentOps threshold gate.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **AgentOps can now delegate Foundry eval execution to `azd ai agent eval`.**
  Projects with an azd `eval.yaml` recipe can set `execution: azd` and
  `eval_recipe: eval.yaml`; AgentOps invokes azd, normalizes emitted metrics
  into `results.json`, binds thresholds including Rubric/custom dimensions, and
  fails closed when configured thresholds do not map to emitted metrics.
- **Governance evidence support for ASSERT, ACS, and red-team readiness.**
  `agentops.yaml` can reference `assert_path`, `acs_path`, and `redteam_path`.
  Doctor, Cockpit, and release evidence record path, SHA-256 hash, status, and
  ACS checkpoint coverage without executing ASSERT, applying ACS controls, or
  exposing red-team payload text.
- **`agentops-governance` coding-agent skill.** The new skill drafts safe
  evidence templates for ASSERT policies, ACS contracts, Guided Guardrail review
  notes, and red-team readiness plans while explicitly refusing offensive
  payload generation.

### Fixed
- **Prompt-agent tutorial now explicitly verifies the Travel Agent dataset path
  after `agentops init`.** Step 7 now tells users to confirm
  `agentops.yaml` points at `.agentops/data/travel-smoke.jsonl` and provides a
  repair command if the wizard left the starter `.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl`.
- **`agentops eval init` now reuses configured prompt-agent inputs and avoids
  hidden azd prompts.** When `--dataset` is omitted, the command passes the
  existing `agentops.yaml` dataset to `azd ai agent eval init`. It also runs azd
  with `--no-prompt`, passes the configured Foundry project endpoint, agent
  name, prompt file, and bootstrap model, and prints a progress line before the
  potentially long Foundry initialization.
- **Prompt-agent tutorial guidance now keeps azd eval recipes advanced-only.**
  Step 10 now follows `workflow analyze` for the quickstart's AgentOps cloud
  eval path and explains that `agentops eval init` requires a full azd AI agent
  project context before `azd ai agent eval run` can resolve the Foundry
  project.
- **`agentops eval init` now prints safely on Windows terminals without Unicode
  support.** The CLI falls back to an ASCII updated marker instead of raising a
  `UnicodeEncodeError` on cp1252 consoles after it wires `execution: azd` and
  `eval_recipe`.
- **Foundry RBAC preflight now prevents the portal build-agent permission
  block.** The prompt-agent, hosted-agent, and end-to-end tutorials plus the
  packaged `agentops-eval` skill now grant `Foundry User` and `Cognitive
  Services OpenAI User` on the parent AI Services account using stable role IDs.
  This covers the Foundry UI's "You don't have permission to build agents"
  failure as well as the evaluator chat-completions data-plane failure, while
  still assigning the OpenAI role to Foundry/Azure AI managed identities used by
  server-side graders.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **`agentops init` now handles blank required wizard values gracefully.** If
  the user presses Enter without an existing Foundry endpoint or agent default,
  the wizard explains that AgentOps needs the missing value and re-prompts
  instead of proceeding to a later persistence failure. Scripted blank flags
  such as `--agent ""` now exit with the same friendly message and no traceback.
- **`agentops init` no longer depends on undeclared PyYAML.** The setup wizard
  now reads and writes `agentops.yaml` through the repository's `ruamel.yaml`
  helpers, fixing the ugly `No module named 'yaml'` traceback seen in clean
  installs.

### Changed
- **AgentOps brand tagline sequence now reads `Evaluate :: Ship :: Observe ::
  Own`.** The startup/explain banner now matches the intended product story
  order.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **RBAC preflight now covers Foundry/Azure AI managed identities, not only
  the signed-in user.** Cloud evaluations run server-side and some agent or
  grader calls authenticate as the managed identities on the backing AI
  Services account and child Foundry project. Granting `Cognitive Services
  OpenAI User` only to the user still allowed intermittent grader
  `AuthenticationError` failures and the v0.3.6 execution warning. The
  prompt-agent, hosted-agent, and end-to-end tutorials plus the
  `agentops-eval` skill now assign the same data-plane role to every managed
  identity in the Foundry resource group, preventing the warning/failure path
  before `agentops eval run`.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **`agentops eval run` now distinguishes a grader *execution* failure from a
  quality-gate failure.** When evaluator workers error out on a subset of rows
  (auth/RBAC/timeout), no row has every grader return a score, so
  `items_passed_all` is `0` and the run reports `Threshold status: FAILED` even
  though every threshold that *could* be computed passed. The CLI now detects
  this case (errored graders combined with all thresholds passing) and prints a
  `Warning` explaining that this is an execution error, not a quality
  regression, names the most common cause (data-plane RBAC granted moments
  earlier that is still propagating to the evaluator workers), surfaces the
  first underlying grader error, and advises waiting a few minutes before
  re-running. The exit-code contract is unchanged. Added the
  `_grader_error_summary` helper plus focused unit tests.
- **Corrected the RBAC propagation guidance in the tutorials and the
  `agentops-eval` skill.** Data-plane role assignments on Cognitive Services
  accounts can take several minutes (not 30-120 seconds) to reach the
  independent, per-row evaluator workers, which can produce an *intermittent*
  `FAILED` with otherwise-green thresholds on the first run after granting
  access. The prompt-agent, hosted-agent, and end-to-end tutorials and the
  skill now describe this symptom and tell readers to wait and re-run rather
  than lower thresholds.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **`agentops-eval` coding-agent skill now preflights the data-plane RBAC
  step that the Foundry portal does not assign by default.** Creating a
  Foundry project through the portal only grants the user `Foundry User`
  at the *project* scope, which does not cover
  `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/deployments/chat/completions/action`
  on the parent AI Services account where chat completions actually live.
  Subscription `Owner` is also insufficient because the built-in `Owner`
  role definition has `actions: ["*"]` but `dataActions: []`. The first
  `agentops eval run` against a fresh workspace therefore failed with
  `PermissionDenied` on every AI-assisted evaluator and every cloud-eval
  grader. The skill's new **Step 0.5 - Ensure data-plane RBAC on the AI
  Services account** resolves the Foundry project endpoint from
  `.azure/<env>/.env` or `.agentops/.env`, looks up the backing AI
  Services account + resource group with
  `az cognitiveservices account list`, fetches the signed-in object ID
  with `az ad signed-in-user show`, and runs an idempotent
  `az role assignment create` for `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` at
  the resource-group scope before handing off to `agentops eval analyze`.
  This keeps the skill experience consistent with the new manual
  instructions added to the prompt-agent, hosted-agent, and end-to-end
  tutorials, so users running the skill against a fresh Foundry project
  no longer hit the same 401 the manual tutorials previously hid.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **`agentops eval run` in local execution mode no longer fails with
  `Missing environment variables: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` when only the
  Foundry project endpoint is configured.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the
  user-facing env-var docs both stated that `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is
  "auto-derived from the project endpoint when absent", but
  `pipeline/runtime.py::_model_config` only read the explicit
  `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` env var with no fallback — so a fresh workspace
  created by `agentops init` (which writes `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
  but not `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`) would always trip the missing-env error
  the first time AI-assisted evaluators tried to run locally. The new
  helper `agentops.utils.azure_endpoints.derive_openai_endpoint_from_project`
  trims the trailing `/api/projects/<name>` segment from a Foundry project
  URL (covering both `services.ai.azure.com` and the legacy
  `cognitiveservices.azure.com` hosts) to recover the AI Services account
  base URL, which is exactly what the `openai` and `azure-ai-evaluation`
  SDKs want. `_model_config` now uses the derived value as a fallback
  whenever `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is unset, so the documented behavior
  finally matches the runtime. When `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` is the only
  thing missing, the error message now points users at the deployment list
  in the Foundry portal *and* mentions the `execution: cloud` escape hatch
  in `agentops.yaml` so the next step is obvious without leaving the
  terminal.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **Runtime dependencies now have upper bounds so a future SDK major release
  cannot silently break installs.** `pyproject.toml` previously declared every
  Azure-SDK dependency with only a lower bound (e.g. `azure-ai-projects>=2.0.1`),
  so `pip install agentops-accelerator` could resolve `azure-ai-projects 3.x`
  the day after that ships and break the agent-definition serialization (the
  exact failure mode that produced the `invalid_payload — Required properties
  ["kind"] are not present` regression below). Each Azure SDK dependency
  (`azure-ai-projects`, `azure-ai-evaluation`, `azure-identity`, `azure-monitor-*`,
  `azure-mgmt-*`) is now constrained to its current major. `pandas`, `fastapi`,
  `uvicorn`, `httpx`, and `markdown` are similarly capped to their next major.
  `cryptography` is intentionally left unbounded so security patches can flow
  through without a coordinated AgentOps release. Lift any of these bounds via
  an explicit PR that exercises the new SDK against `tests/`.

- **`agentops workflow generate` now stamps the installed agentops version
  into generated CI/CD templates instead of always installing from
  `git+...@main`.** Every generated `agentops-pr.yml`, `agentops-deploy-*.yml`,
  `agentops-watchdog.yml` (and their Azure DevOps pipeline equivalents) used to
  contain `pip install "agentops-accelerator[...] @ git+https://github.com/Azure/agentops.git@main"`,
  with no version pin and a stale "NOTE: pinned to GitHub main until the next
  package release" comment. User CI runs were therefore non-reproducible: the
  same workflow file pulled different agentops snapshots day to day, which is
  how PO's recorded tutorial took a hard SDK regression mid-record. The
  generator now writes a literal `==X.Y.Z` pin derived from the agentops version
  currently installed on the machine running `agentops workflow generate` — so
  a user who generates workflows against AgentOps `0.3.3` always installs
  `agentops-accelerator==0.3.3` on every CI run, and `agentops-accelerator`
  brings exact-major Azure SDKs along (per the upper bounds above). Editable
  installs (versions carrying a local segment like `+gabcdef` or marked
  `.devN`) keep the `@main` fallback so contributors testing template changes
  still get a resolvable install. Existing user workflows are unaffected until
  the user re-runs `agentops workflow generate --force` against a release of
  AgentOps that ships this change.

### Fixed
- **Doctor regression check no longer flags the previous PR run as "current"
  in CI.** The results-history loader (`agent/sources/results_history.py`)
  was reading the wrong fields from `results.json` and excluding
  `.agentops/results/latest/` from the candidate list. Three coordinated
  schema-alignment fixes restore correctness:
  1. `_summarize` now reads top-level `aggregate_metrics` first (the field
     the orchestrator actually writes, per `core/results.py`), then falls
     back to legacy `metrics`/`run_metrics`. Previously the loader looked
     only at the legacy fields, so every freshly-written local
     `RunSummary` had `metrics = {}` and the regression check could never
     see the current run's metrics.
  2. `_summarize` now reads `summary.overall_passed` first when deriving
     the `run_pass` flag, then falls back to the legacy `summary.run_pass`
     / `metrics.run_pass` shapes.
  3. `_summarize` now orders runs by `timestamp` → `finished_at` →
     `started_at` → `created_at` → `summary.timestamp`. The previous list
     omitted `finished_at`/`started_at`, which are the two fields
     `results.json` actually contains, so every loaded run defaulted to
     epoch-zero ordering.
  4. `_collect_local_runs` now includes `.agentops/results/latest/` when it
     is the only local results directory. In CI, generated workflows run
     `agentops eval run --output .agentops/results/latest` and write
     nowhere else; the old loader unconditionally skipped `latest/` for
     dev-mode dedup, so in CI `local_runs` was always empty. With cloud
     listing trailing behind by seconds (eventual consistency), the
     regression check would then compute `latest = previous_run` and
     blame the just-completed candidate's coherence/groundedness on the
     prior PR. Dev-mode dedup is preserved: when a timestamped sibling
     exists, `latest/` is still skipped.
- **Prompt-agent deploy: `stage` no longer fails with `Required properties ["kind"] are not present` against `azure-ai-projects` 2.x.**
  `_copy_definition` previously called `.copy()` on the typed
  `PromptAgentDefinition` returned by `get_version`. In SDK 1.x that
  preserved the typed model so the body serialized as a flat
  `{"kind": "prompt", "model": ..., "instructions": ...}`. In SDK 2.x
  the same `.copy()` returns a stripped base `Model` whose JSON shape
  is `{"_data": {"kind": "prompt", ...}}`, and `.get("kind")` returns
  `None` — so the request body that reached the Foundry Agents service
  contained `definition: {"_data": {...}}` with no top-level `kind`,
  and the service rejected it with `invalid_payload`. This regression
  only fired on the `created` action path (i.e. when the user's prompt
  differed from the seed); the `reused` and bootstrap paths were
  unaffected because they don't round-trip the typed model through
  `.copy()`. `_copy_definition` now normalizes any SDK definition
  object to a plain `dict` before mutation, and `_create_agent_version`
  no longer puts a root-level `kind` on the request body (the new API
  treats `kind` strictly as the discriminator inside `definition`).
- **Tutorial: prompt-agent step 13 now shows the steady-state `foundry-agent.json` (action: reused) instead of the bootstrap edge case.**
  The example JSON in step 13 previously showed `action: bootstrapped`
  with `candidate_agent: "travel-agent:1"` and a "the two numbers are
  expected to differ until the environment has caught up to the seed"
  explanation. In practice the merge-triggered deploy is almost never
  the run that bootstraps — by the time the user reaches step 13, the
  skill's verification dispatch in step 12 plus the first PR run have
  already settled dev to `travel-agent:2`, so the merge deploy reports
  `action: reused` with `candidate_agent: "travel-agent:2"` (matching
  `source_agent`). The example now shows the steady-state shape (taken
  from a real recording), uses the runner-resolved absolute paths the
  user actually sees (`/home/runner/work/<your-repo>/...`), and uses a
  real 64-char `prompt_sha256` + a real ISO timestamp. The
  three-outcome list (`reused` / `created` / `bootstrapped`) below the
  JSON keeps the bootstrap case as the documented edge condition.
- **Tutorial: prompt-agent step 13 now matches what the workflow skill actually does (dispatches both workflows).**
  PR #211 mistakenly narrowed the step 13 callout to say the workflow
  skill only dispatches `agentops-pr.yml` as a verification run, based
  on incorrect reasoning about `push:` triggers (the skill actually
  uses `workflow_dispatch`, which works against any branch regardless
  of the workflow's `push:` block). In practice — verified against a
  live recording — the skill dispatches **both** `agentops-pr.yml`
  and `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` end-to-end as part of CI verification,
  asking the user to approve first per SKILL.md rule #14. The step 13
  callout now reflects this and explains the expected outcome (both
  runs may exit `threshold_failed` on first contact with an empty dev
  project because the bootstrap path produces a fresh `travel-agent:1`
  that has not been measured against the seed thresholds yet — by
  design, not a CI wiring failure). The "What you should see in the
  first PR workflow run" section also updates from the
  "dev is still empty" assumption (which becomes false after the
  skill's verification dispatch) to the three possible outcomes
  (`reused` / `created` / `bootstrapped`) you can actually see at this
  point. The "After the merge" paragraph now calls out that the
  merge-triggered deploy is the **second** deploy-dev run for the
  repo, not the first.
- **Tutorials: end-to-end audit caught misleading dist URLs, phantom CLI commands, missing JSON fields, and stale Doctor advisory text.**
  All three tutorials previously installed the development build from a
  personal fork URL (`git+https://github.com/placerda/agentops.git@develop`);
  they now point at the canonical
  `git+https://github.com/Azure/agentops.git@develop`. The prompt-agent
  tutorial referenced a non-existent `prompt_deploy record` subcommand in
  two places — the actual command is `prompt_deploy summarize`, matching
  `src/agentops/pipeline/prompt_deploy.py` and the deploy template's
  `Mark candidate as deployed` step. The same tutorial's `foundry-agent.json`
  sample was missing the `eval_config` field that the code writes at
  `src/agentops/pipeline/prompt_deploy.py:186`. The step 12 skill prompt
  and the step 13 prose did not tell the reader to rewrite the dev-deploy
  trigger from `develop` to `main` for this trunk-on-`main` tutorial; the
  generator's stock default is `develop`, which would silently no-op after
  the first merge. Step 12 now instructs the skill to do the rewrite (and
  the bullet list of skill actions calls it out as a required step, with
  a manual-edit fallback). Step 13's "deploy fires automatically on `main`"
  sentence now states the dependency on the step 12 rewrite explicitly,
  and the placeholder phrase "your trunk branch" is now disambiguated as
  "`main` in this tutorial". The end-to-end tutorial's step 5 and step 9
  Doctor descriptions still read as if Doctor were advisory-only in PR
  workflows — that text predates the `--doctor-gate critical` default;
  both blocks now describe the actual behavior (critical findings block
  the PR by default; warning/info are evidence-only).

### Changed
- **Tutorials: skip-if-skill callouts now state the skill's outcome directly and accurately.**
  The `step 13` callout in `docs/tutorial-prompt-agent-quickstart.md` and the
  baseline-run paragraph in `docs/tutorial-end-to-end.md` previously opened
  with "if you used the workflow skill, this is already done…" plus a
  manual-fallback block. That conditional framing was confusing because the
  preceding step (`step 12` of the prompt-agent tutorial, `step 5` of the
  end-to-end tutorial) only documents the workflow-skill path — there is no
  alternative wired-by-hand path the reader could have taken. Both callouts
  now state the skill's outcome directly, and the redundant `git add` /
  `commit` / `push` and `gh workflow run agentops-pr.yml --ref main` blocks
  have been removed (the skill already triggers the first run). A small
  `gh run list` / `gh run watch` snippet remains as an opt-in way to wait
  on the run from the terminal instead of the Actions UI. The previous
  wording also over-claimed that the skill triggered verification runs of
  **both** `agentops-pr.yml` and `agentops-deploy-dev.yml`; the skill only
  dispatches the PR workflow as a sanity check (`workflow_dispatch`), while
  `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` triggers on the first real merge into the trunk
  branch. The callout now reflects this accurately and notes that the
  deploy-dev run happens at the end of the section, not during the skill's
  setup.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **Tutorials now flag the workflow skill's setup actions as redundant in the manual follow-up steps.**
  When users run the `agentops-workflow` skill in the CI-wiring step of either
  the prompt-agent tutorial (step 12) or the end-to-end tutorial (step 5, the
  same skill invocation that precedes the baseline-run step), the skill already
  commits the workspace, pushes `main` to GitHub, and triggers a first
  verification run of `agentops-pr.yml` (and `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` for the
  prompt-agent flow). The next step previously asked users to repeat all
  three actions, which was a no-op at best and confusing at worst (the
  `git add` would find nothing to commit, the `git push` would report
  up-to-date, the dispatched PR run would be the second one, not the first).
  Step 13 of `docs/tutorial-prompt-agent-quickstart.md` and the baseline-run
  paragraph in `docs/tutorial-end-to-end.md` now open with an explicit
  "if you used the workflow skill above, this is already done" callout and
  reframe the manual commands as a fallback for users who skipped the skill
  or wired CI by hand. The deliberate baseline-PR step that follows (open a
  feature branch, open a PR, merge once green) is unchanged — it must still
  go through a real pull request, which the skill does not do for you, so
  that the rolling Doctor history is seeded.
- **Tutorial wording: "quickstart" → "tutorial", "workshop" → "tutorial".**
  The three documentation entries that were labeled "Prompt Agent quickstart",
  "Hosted Agent quickstart", and "End-to-end workshop" now read as "Foundry
  Prompt Agent tutorial", "Hosted or HTTP Agent tutorial", and "End-to-end
  tutorial" across `README.md`, `plugins/agentops/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/doctor-explained.md`, the `agentops-workflow`
  skill (both synced copies), and the H1s + cross-references inside each
  tutorial doc. The README description for the end-to-end tutorial now also
  states explicitly that it **extends** either of the type-specific tutorials
  (sandbox → dev → qa → prod plus Foundry red-team scans plus
  trace-to-regression promotion) so the difference between the three is
  obvious at a glance. The "quickstart" framing no longer fits doc bodies
  that grew past 1000 lines covering multi-environment promotion, regression
  injection, Doctor evidence, and Cockpit. The tutorial **filenames are
  intentionally preserved** (`tutorial-*-quickstart.md`) to keep inbound
  links and bookmarks stable.
- **Skill + tutorial guidance now require `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` as a prerequisite RBAC role.**
  The `agentops-workflow` skill, `tutorial-prompt-agent-quickstart.md`,
  `tutorial-end-to-end.md`, and `docs/ci-github-actions.md` now instruct users
  to grant the OIDC/CI service principal **both** Foundry User on the Foundry
  project **and** Cognitive Services OpenAI User on the underlying Azure AI
  Services account that hosts the evaluator model deployment. Foundry
  `azure_ai_evaluator` graders impersonate the OIDC principal to call OpenAI;
  without the OpenAI User role they fail with a 401 `PermissionDenied` and
  every cloud eval metric returns `null`, blocking the first PR run. The skill
  now emits the matching `az role assignment create` commands for both roles
  (role ids `53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d` and
  `5e0bd9bd-7b93-4f28-af87-19fc36ad61bd`) before dispatching the workflow.

### Fixed
- **`agentops init --azd-env <name>` no longer pre-fills the endpoint from a different env.**
  When the user explicitly targets a new azd env (e.g. `--azd-env dev` while the
  active env is `sandbox`), the wizard now refuses to pre-fill
  `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` from sources that don't match the
  targeted env — process environment, legacy top-level `project_endpoint:` in
  `agentops.yaml`, or a *different* `.azure/<env>/.env` file. Instead it
  prompts with no default and prints a short note explaining where the
  suspect default came from (e.g. "the active azd env `sandbox`'s
  `.azure/sandbox/.env`"). This stops the silent sandbox→dev endpoint leak
  that surfaced when users ran the multi-env tutorials; values picked up
  from the targeted env's own `.azure/<env>/.env` are still honored. The
  strict check only fires when `--azd-env` is passed explicitly — bare
  `agentops init` keeps its existing best-effort default behavior.
- **Cloud eval surfaces grader execution errors instead of silent nulls.**
  When a Foundry `azure_ai_evaluator` grader fails to execute (most
  commonly because the evaluator service principal lacks
  `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the target model deployment), the
  per-metric `score` comes back `null` and the real cause is buried in
  `result.sample.error.message`. The cloud-results parser now lifts that
  message into `RowMetric.error` (including the error `code` prefix
  when present), so the actionable error appears in `results.json` and
  `report.md` instead of operators only seeing `actual=missing` in the
  threshold table. The orchestrator's "0 usable metric scores" warning
  also quotes the first grader error so CI logs carry the signal
  without operators having to download the raw artifact.

### Added
- **`cloud_output_items.json` is now uploaded as a CI artifact.** Generated PR and deploy workflows (GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps) include `.agentops/results/latest/cloud_output_items.json` in the `agentops-*-results` artifact bundle alongside `results.json`, `report.md`, and `cloud_evaluation.json`. Pairs with the "0 usable scores" warning so operators can diagnose unrecognized Foundry grader shapes without re-running locally.
- **`cloud_output_items.json` raw dump.** Every cloud eval run now
  writes the raw `output_items` it received from Foundry to
  `<output_dir>/cloud_output_items.json`, in addition to the parsed
  `results.json`. When a future grader / SDK upgrade changes the on-the-
  wire shape and the parser stops finding scores, the artifact bundle
  alone is enough to triage the issue. The orchestrator also emits an
  explicit warning to the progress channel when a cloud run yields zero
  usable metric scores despite returning rows, pointing the user at the
  new dump file.
- **`.gitattributes`** pinning `*.yml` / `*.yaml` / `*.sh` / `*.md` /
  `*.py` to LF line endings, preventing future CRLF↔LF churn from
  Windows clones with `core.autocrlf=true`. Normalizes the existing
  `_build.yml` and `ci.yml` (previously CRLF) to LF so all files in
  `.github/workflows/` share a single line-ending convention.

### Removed
- **Retired tombstone publish jobs from CI.** The `agentops-toolkit` →
  `agentops-accelerator` deprecation tombstones were one-shot publishes
  for v0.3.0 / v0.3.1; the `build-pypi-tombstone`,
  `publish-tombstone-testpypi`, `verify-tombstone-testpypi`,
  `publish-tombstone-pypi`, and `publish-tombstone-vsix(-prerelease)`
  jobs (plus their `cut-release.yml` plugin-version sync steps) have
  been removed from `release.yml`, `staging.yml`, and `cut-release.yml`.
  The `github-release` job now depends only on `publish-pypi` and
  `publish-vsix` (both required), and the dead `always()` guard has
  been dropped. Future releases ship only `agentops-accelerator` on
  PyPI and the `AgentOpsAccelerator.agentops-accelerator` VSIX.
  The orphaned `scripts/verify_tombstones.py` harness and
  `docs/verifying-tombstones.md` checklist (both one-shot tools
  whose CI counterpart no longer exists) have been removed, along
  with the now-unused `tombstones/pypi/` package source and the
  `tombstones/vscode/` extension source — only
  `tombstones/vscode/CDN_DEPRECATION_REQUEST.md` survives as the
  template for the still-pending Microsoft CDN deprecation request.

### Fixed
- **Cloud-eval parser no longer returns null scores for Foundry
  `azure_ai_evaluator` graders.** The parser now probes a wider set of
  score-carrier keys (`score`, `value`, `result`, `metric_value`,
  `rating`, `grader_score`, `numeric_value`), falls back to `passed`
  (bool) and then `label` (`"pass"` / `"fail"` strings), and descends
  into `sample` / `details` as a final resort. Treats `score: 0` as a
  legitimate value (was previously coerced to `None` in some paths).
  Without this fix, every metric in a Foundry cloud run came back
  `value: null` against the real on-the-wire shape — the `report.md`
  threshold table showed every metric as `actual=missing` and exit code
  2 fired with `Threshold status: FAILED` even when the run itself
  succeeded.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Auto-bootstrap empty Foundry projects on first deploy.** New optional
  `prompt_agent_bootstrap` block in `agentops.yaml` lets the prompt-agent
  deploy workflow create the first version of an agent in a dev / qa / prod
  Foundry project that does not yet have one. When the stage step looks up
  the seed agent and gets a 404, it reads the model deployment (required)
  plus optional `description`, `model_parameters`, and `tools` from
  `prompt_agent_bootstrap`, combines them with `prompt_file`, and creates
  the first version automatically. The deployment artifact records the new
  `action: "bootstrapped"` for that first run; subsequent deploys follow
  the normal reuse / next-version flow. Eliminates the previous
  per-environment manual seeding step. `agentops workflow analyze` now
  warns when a prompt-agent workspace is missing this block. Authentication
  (401 / 403) and other non-404 errors continue to propagate — the
  bootstrap path only triggers on a genuine "agent does not exist" 404.
- **`--doctor-gate` flag on `agentops workflow generate`.** New option
  `--doctor-gate critical|warning|none` controls the Doctor severity floor
  in the PR workflow template. Default is `critical`, which makes the PR
  Doctor step block on critical Doctor findings (notably the
  `regression.<metric>` checks that fire when an evaluator metric drops
  meaningfully from the rolling baseline). This catches drift such as
  groundedness moving from 5.0 to 4.0 even when the configured eval
  thresholds technically still pass. `--doctor-gate warning` blocks on
  warnings or higher; `--doctor-gate none` restores the pre-1.x advisory
  behavior. Only the PR template is affected — deploy templates continue
  to run with `--severity-fail critical` regardless.
- **Stage-then-eval PR workflow for Foundry prompt agents.** When
  `--deploy-mode prompt-agent` is in effect, `agentops workflow generate
  --kinds pr` now emits a PR workflow (and Azure DevOps pipeline) that
  stages an ephemeral Foundry candidate prompt-agent version from
  `prompt_file` in the dev Foundry project, then evaluates that exact
  candidate (instead of the seed agent pinned in `agentops.yaml`). This
  makes the PR gate meaningful for prompt-agent flows: regressions are
  caught at PR time, not after merge. Candidates accumulate in the dev
  project across PRs and may need periodic cleanup.

### Changed
- **Renamed PyPI distribution and VS Code publisher.** The PyPI
  distribution name changed from `agentops-toolkit` to
  `agentops-accelerator`, and the VS Code Marketplace publisher
  changed from `AgentOpsToolkit` to `AgentOpsAccelerator`. The
  resulting extension ID flips from
  `AgentOpsToolkit.agentops-toolkit` to
  `AgentOpsAccelerator.agentops-accelerator`. The Python import
  (`import agentops`) and CLI command (`agentops ...`) are
  unchanged — only the install/distribution identifier changed.
  Install with `pip install agentops-accelerator` or
  `uv pip install agentops-accelerator`. Two deprecation tombstones
  are published atomically with this release so existing users are
  guided to the new identifiers:

  - **PyPI tombstone**: `pip install agentops-toolkit` keeps working
    via a metapackage at `tombstones/pypi/` that pins
    `agentops-accelerator>=0.3.0` (no shadow code, no auto-discovery).
    The package long-description on PyPI links to the migration
    instructions.
  - **VS Code Marketplace tombstone**: a final
    `AgentOpsToolkit.agentops-toolkit` extension at `tombstones/vscode/`
    activates with a one-time prompt offering to install
    `AgentOpsAccelerator.agentops-accelerator` (or open the Marketplace
    page in a browser). A per-install storage sentinel prevents
    re-prompts after the user resolves it.

  The release tag (`v0.3.0`) drives all four publishes
  (agentops-accelerator + agentops-toolkit on PyPI, plus the new and
  legacy VSIX publishers) through gated jobs in `release.yml`. The
  tombstones are gated AFTER the corresponding main publish jobs so
  the worst-case failure mode is "tombstone delayed, recoverable in
  v0.3.1" — never "tombstone-without-new". (#181)
- **Default PR Doctor behavior is now blocking.** Generating workflows
  without `--doctor-gate` produces a PR template that blocks on critical
  Doctor findings. Existing workflows continue to work unchanged; only
  re-generated workflows pick up the new default. To opt back into the
  previous advisory behavior, run
  `agentops workflow generate --doctor-gate none --force`.
- **`--deploy-mode prompt-agent` now changes the generated PR workflow.**
  Re-running `agentops workflow generate --deploy-mode prompt-agent
  --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod --force` produces a different PR template than
  before (it now stages a Foundry candidate before evaluating). Other
  modes (`auto`, `placeholder`, `azd`) continue to produce the previous
  generic PR template.
- Prompt and hosted agent eval defaults now use judge-based response
  completeness instead of token-overlap F1, keeping F1 as the default for
  exact-reference `model:<deployment>` checks or explicit evaluator overrides.

### Notes for developers
- **Editable install cleanup after rebrand.** Developers with an
  existing local editable install (`uv pip install -e .` or
  `pip install -e .`) may have a stale
  `src/agentops_toolkit.egg-info/` directory or stale
  `importlib.metadata` entries pointing to the old distribution
  name after pulling this release. Clean up with:
  `rm -rf src/*.egg-info && uv pip install -e .` (or
  `rm -rf src/*.egg-info && pip install -e .` for pip). This is
  a one-time, dev-only step; CI runs are unaffected because they
  create fresh virtual environments, and end users installing
  from PyPI are unaffected because wheels carry the new
  `dist-info` directory directly. (#181)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Release workflow verification.** Release builds now pin package versions from
  the release tag, assert the generated distribution matches that version, and
  fail TestPyPI verification immediately when the expected package is not
  available.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Consolidated the tutorial set into two quickstarts plus one end-to-end
  Foundry + AgentOps workshop, with the quickstarts now covering the broader
  Foundry build/debug/evaluate/observe journey before AgentOps readiness.
- Made the quickstarts self-contained around a Travel Agent example, including
  prompt-agent creation, hosted HTTP endpoint creation, and travel-specific
  eval datasets without local workspace install paths.
- Updated the tutorials to prefer the interactive `agentops init` wizard,
  explain evaluator deployment separately from initialization, and include
  forced regression/fix loops for prompt and hosted agent paths.
- Re-ask starter `agent` and `dataset` values during the first interactive
  `agentops init` run so tutorial users replace `my-agent:1` with their target.
- Removed the interactive App Insights question from `agentops init`; runtime
  commands discover it from the Foundry project when possible, and
  `--appinsights-connection-string` remains available for explicit setup.
- Made `workflow analyze` output use a lighter PowerShell-friendly summary,
  Markdown tables, and user-facing Foundry eval labels; also removed a
  non-actionable latency warning from the normal analysis output.
- Made `workflow generate` next steps gentler for PowerShell and tutorial users:
  PR/watchdog-only output now asks for only the `dev` environment, explains
  that deploy setup can wait, and points users to Copilot-assisted GitHub/OIDC
  setup.

### Fixed
- **Doctor App Insights discovery.** The `azure_monitor` source now falls back
  to an App Insights `ApplicationId` from `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`
  or Foundry project telemetry discovery, so Doctor no longer reports runtime
  telemetry as unconfigured when Cockpit can already resolve App Insights.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Release evidence packs.** Added the release evidence schema and Doctor
  evidence-pack writer so teams can produce review-ready production promotion
  artifacts from existing readiness signals.
- **Trace promotion workflow.** Added trace export promotion into reviewable
  dataset candidates so production learnings can become future regression
  coverage.
- **Workflow analysis and prompt-agent deployment templates.** Added CI/CD
  analysis plus GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps templates for prompt-agent
  deployment paths.
- **Production readiness guidance.** Added the production readiness tutorial
  and release-readiness Doctor checks to connect evaluation gates, evidence,
  and deployment readiness.
- **Pre-flight checks for `agentops eval run`** - detects common issues (missing `azure-identity` or `azure-ai-evaluation` packages, missing env vars for AI-assisted/safety evaluators, Azure credential failures, unreachable endpoints) *before* backend execution. All detectable issues are reported at once with actionable error messages and `pip install` hints.
- **`--dry-run` / `-n` flag on `eval run`** - runs pre-flight checks without executing the evaluation. Exits 0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise. Useful for CI gating and fast feedback.
- **Credential warm-up in pre-flight** - acquires and caches the MSAL token once during pre-flight so subsequent evaluator calls don't each cold-start `az.cmd`.

### Changed
- **AgentOps 1.0 workspace and documentation refresh.** Updated the CLI,
  templates, skills, examples, and docs around the flat `agentops.yaml`
  workflow, azd-compatible initialization, Doctor/Cockpit readiness, and
  production evaluation loops.
- **`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` is now auto-normalized.** When the env
  var includes the portal-style inference-path suffix
  (e.g. `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1`,
  `/openai/`, `/openai/deployments`), AgentOps strips it before
  passing the value to the `azure-ai-evaluation` SDK and the
  `openai` client. Trailing slashes are also trimmed. The user can
  paste whichever URL the Foundry portal showed and the eval
  pipeline now works transparently.
- **Doctor categories aligned to WAF-AI pillars (breaking).** The
  `genaiops` category was renamed to `operational_excellence` to match
  the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework for AI pillar names. Every
  doctor finding id with the `genaiops.` prefix was renamed to `opex.`
  (the WAF checklist, cockpit rows, report grouping, and CLI
  `--categories` flag are now all named consistently). The
  `checks/mlops.py` module was renamed to `checks/opex_workspace.py`
  and its function `run_mlops_check` to `run_opex_workspace_check`.
  A read-only legacy-id shim (`agentops/agent/_legacy_ids.py`)
  rewrites legacy `genaiops.*` rule ids in
  `checks.llm_assist.rules` and legacy `--categories genaiops` flags
  in memory at load time with a one-shot deprecation warning; update
  your config to the canonical names - the legacy aliases will be
  removed in a future release.
- **Azure CLI credential timeout raised to 30s** - all `DefaultAzureCredential` instantiation sites (`eval_engine.py`, `foundry_backend.py`) now pass `process_timeout=30`. Default (10s) is insufficient for Windows `az.cmd` cold starts and was causing intermittent `AzureCliCredential: Failed to invoke the Azure CLI` errors.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Single source of truth for skills (closes #87)** - `src/agentops/templates/skills/` is now the canonical location. Added `scripts/sync-skills.sh` and `scripts/sync-skills.ps1` to propagate changes to `plugins/agentops/skills/`. CI test `test_skills_sync.py` fails if the two directories diverge.
- **Optional unit test generation** - `agentops-eval` skill (Step 1) now offers to generate unit tests for agent code when no existing tests are detected. Generates `pytest` + `unittest.mock` tests covering endpoint handlers, response parsing, and error handling. Opt-in only - skips silently if tests already exist or user declines.

### Changed
- **Cross-platform subprocess handling in generated scripts** - `agentops-eval` and `agentops-dataset` skills now instruct generated `rag_context.py` scripts to use `shutil.which()` + `shell=(sys.platform == "win32")` when calling external CLIs, preventing `FileNotFoundError` on Windows.
- **Auth detection carrythrough to callable adapter** - `agentops-eval` skill Step 5.5 now explicitly wires the auth pattern detected in Step 2 into the adapter using generic `AGENT_AUTH_HEADER` and `AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN` env vars. Updated `callable_adapter.py` template to use the same generic auth mechanism. Prevents 401 errors on first smoke test.
- **azd environment validation** - `agentops-eval` (Step 4) and `agentops-config` (Step 3) skills now validate azd environments before trusting `.azure/<env>/.env` values: checks `azd env list`, verifies resource group exists via `az group exists`, and warns on stale environments.
- **Enhanced smoke test diagnostics** - `agentops-eval` skill Step 6 smoke test now checks for empty responses, response length, response format mismatches (JSON vs SSE), unexpected prefixes (UUIDs), and HTML error pages. Expanded troubleshooting table with specific remediation steps.
- **Updated CONTRIBUTING.md** - added single-source-of-truth rule for skills and sync script instructions.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Unified changelog** - removed separate `plugins/agentops/CHANGELOG.md`; CI now copies the root changelog into the VSIX package. Single source of truth for both CLI and extension.
- **Removed `[Unreleased]` changelog pattern** - changelog entries are now added directly under versioned sections.
- **Configured Dependabot** - added `.github/dependabot.yml` targeting `develop` for pip, GitHub Actions, and npm ecosystems.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Make release pipeline resilient to VSIX version conflicts** - add `continue-on-error` on VSIX publish and decouple GitHub Release from VSIX publish result, preventing staging pre-release "already exists" failures from blocking the release.
- **Resolve 31 mypy type errors and enforce mypy in CI** - strict type checking added to the `lint` job (`mypy --strict src/`), fixing errors across `foundry_backend.py`, `eval_engine.py`, `reporter.py`, `runner.py`, `comparison.py`, and `browse.py`.
- **Resolve 18 ruff lint errors** (F401 unused imports, F811 redefinition, F841 unused variables) across 6 source and test files.
- **Fix UV cache race condition in CI** - disable UV cache on non-matrix jobs (lint, coverage, publish-dev) that shared cache keys with the test matrix, eliminating `Failed to save: Unable to reserve cache` warnings.

### Changed
- **Upgrade GitHub Actions to Node.js 24 runtimes** - update `actions/checkout` to v6, `actions/setup-python` to v5, `astral-sh/setup-uv` to v7, `actions/upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` to v7 across all CI/CD workflows.
- **Apply ruff-format across source and workflows** - normalize code style and whitespace across backends, services, CLI, tests, and workflow YAML files.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Resolve all 37 mypy type errors across 6 source files (`foundry_backend.py`, `config_loader.py`, `reporter.py`, `browse.py`, `comparison.py`, `runner.py`).
- Fix VSIX version derivation in CI/CD workflows - use global tag sort (`git tag -l --sort=-v:refname`) instead of `git describe` which misses tags not reachable from the current branch.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Auto-registration of skills in coding agent instruction files** - `agentops skills install` now registers installed skills in the coding agent's instruction file so AI assistants discover them automatically. For Copilot: appends an idempotent marker-delimited block to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with a skill discovery table. For Cursor: writes a managed `.cursor/rules/agentops.mdc` file with `alwaysApply: true`. Repeated runs update the block in place (no duplicates).
- **Cursor platform detection** - `detect_platforms()` now recognises `.cursor/rules/` directory or `.cursorrules` file as Cursor indicators. Cursor skills are installed to `.github/skills/` (shared with Copilot) and registered via `.cursor/rules/agentops.mdc`.
- **Underscore Copilot filename detection** - `detect_platforms()` now silently accepts `copilot_instructions.md` (underscore variant) as a valid Copilot signal alongside the standard `copilot-instructions.md`.
- **`agentops skills install` command** - Installs packaged coding agent skills into consumer projects. Supports GitHub Copilot (`.github/skills/`), Cursor (`.github/skills/`), and Claude Code (`.claude/commands/`). Auto-detects platforms; falls back to GitHub Copilot silently. Pass `--prompt` to ask before installing when no platform is detected. Pass `--platform` for explicit platform selection.
- Packaged skill templates under `src/agentops/templates/skills/` for distribution via `pip install`.
- Extend Foundry cloud evaluation to support 22 built-in evaluators (up from 8), covering quality, agent, safety, RAG, tool, and NLP evaluator categories.
- Add dynamic `item_schema` building - automatically includes `tool_definitions` and `context` fields when the enabled evaluators require them.
- Fix NLP evaluator names in frozensets to match `_to_builtin_evaluator_name` conversion (`bleu_score`, `rouge_score`, `gleu_score`, `meteor_score` instead of `bleu`, `rouge`, `gleu`, `meteor`).
- Add default `initialization_parameters` for `RougeScoreEvaluator` (`rouge_type: rouge1`).
- Add optional OTLP tracing for evaluation runs - set `AGENTOPS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to emit OpenTelemetry spans.
  - Three-layer schema: CICD semconv (pipeline run/task), GenAI semconv (agent invocation), and `agentops.eval.*` (evaluator scores/thresholds).
  - Per-row item spans with evaluator child spans showing score, threshold, and pass/fail.
  - Zero overhead when `AGENTOPS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset; graceful no-op when `opentelemetry-sdk` is not installed.
- Browse commands: `agentops bundle list`, `agentops bundle show`, `agentops run list`, `agentops run show` for workspace inspection.

### Changed
- **Skills optimized for weaker models** - Rewrote all 8 SKILL.md files to reduce cognitive load and token usage. Key changes: replaced prose paragraphs with numbered single-action steps and tables, removed boilerplate ("Before You Start", "When to Use", "Purpose" sections), inlined decision logic into steps (no disconnected decision trees), provided one copy-paste callable adapter template instead of multiple variants, consolidated rules into a single section per skill. Size reductions: `agentops-eval` 613→275 lines (−55%), `agentops-config` 229→170 (−26%), `agentops-report` −35%, `agentops-regression` −35%, `agentops-monitor` −53%, `agentops-trace` −55%, `agentops-workflow` −38%, `agentops-dataset` −11%.
- **Skills discovery improvements** - `agentops-eval` and `agentops-config` skills now auto-discover container app URLs (`az containerapp list`) and webapp URLs (`az webapp list`), detect auth patterns from codebase (Dapr, API key, Bearer), pre-warm Azure CLI tokens to prevent intermittent `AzureCliCredential.get_token failed` errors, and present all discovered values as a confirmation table instead of asking each one separately.
- **Report readability improvements** - `report.md` and HTML reports now include: evaluator descriptions ("What It Measures" column), human-readable metric names (CamelCase split, `_` → spaces), ✅/❌ visual indicators for pass/fail, merged threshold columns (`>= 0.80` instead of separate Criteria/Expected), clean number formatting (drop unnecessary decimal zeros), per-row score tables in Row Details, retrieved context display for RAG evaluations (truncated at 500 chars), "How Pass/Fail Is Determined" section, and one-sentence descriptions after each section heading.
- **`RowMetricsResult` model updated** - Added optional `context` field to `RowMetricsResult` for RAG evaluation context display. All three backends (Foundry, HTTP, local adapter) now populate this field from dataset rows.
- **README restructured** - Simplified Quickstart from 6 steps to 3. Moved evaluation scenarios, configuration model, and run config examples to new `docs/concepts.md` page with ASCII architecture diagram. Removed Project Structure and Copilot Skills sections from README (available in CONTRIBUTING.md and tutorial-copilot-skills.md respectively).

### Added
- `docs/concepts.md` - new conceptual overview page with ASCII evaluation flow diagram, core concept definitions (workspace, run config, bundle, dataset, evaluator, backend), evaluation scenarios table, and configuration model summary.

### Changed
- **CLI refactored to entity-verb pattern** - All CLI commands now follow a consistent `<entity> <verb>` structure:
  - `agentops report` → `agentops report generate`
  - `agentops config cicd` → `agentops workflow generate` (new `workflow` entity)
  - `agentops monitor cockpit` → `agentops monitor show`
  - `agentops monitor alert` → `agentops monitor configure`
- **Skills refactored into modular skills** - 8 single-responsibility skills with `agentops-` prefix: `/agentops-eval` (run evaluations), `/agentops-config` (infer scenario + generate run.yaml), `/agentops-dataset` (generate JSONL + YAML datasets), `/agentops-report` (interpret and regenerate reports), `/agentops-regression` (investigate score drops), `/agentops-trace` (tracing stub), `/agentops-monitor` (monitoring stub), `/agentops-workflow` (CI/CD setup). Decomposed the monolithic `evals` skill into 4 focused skills. Each follows a standardized structure: Purpose, When to Use, Before You Start, Steps, Guardrails, Outputs.
- **Run config model** - The configuration model uses an orthogonal `target`/`hosting`/`execution_mode` model. Configs missing a `version` field or containing a legacy `backend` key are rejected with an actionable error message.
  - `target` section with `type` (agent|model), `hosting` (local|foundry|aks|containerapps), `execution_mode` (local|remote).
  - Remote endpoints configured via `target.endpoint` with `kind: foundry_agent` or `kind: http`.
  - Local adapter configured via `target.local.adapter`.
  - Bundle and dataset references support both `name` (convention-based) and `path` (explicit).
  - `execution` section with `concurrency` and `timeout_seconds`.
  - `run` section for optional `name` and `description` metadata.
- **Backend resolution** based on `execution_mode` + `endpoint.kind`.
- `BackendRunContext` carries full `RunConfig`.
- `publish_foundry_evaluation()` takes `endpoint_config: TargetEndpointConfig`.

### Added
- **Callable adapter mode** for `LocalAdapterBackend` - users can now specify a Python function (`module:function`) via `target.local.callable` instead of spawning a subprocess. The function receives `(input_text: str, context: dict) -> dict` and must return `{"response": "..."}`.
- **Shared evaluation engine** (`backends/eval_engine.py`) - evaluator loading, instantiation, execution, scoring, and dataset utilities extracted from `foundry_backend.py` into a standalone module shared by all backends.
- Starter templates: `callable_adapter.py` (example callable function) and `run-callable.yaml` (run config using callable mode), created by `agentops init`.
- Starter conversational dataset: `smoke-conversational.yaml` + `smoke-conversational.jsonl`, created by `agentops init`.
- Tutorials: `tutorial-conversational-agent.md` (Agent Framework conversational) and `tutorial-agent-workflow.md` (Agent Framework workflow with tools).
- `LocalAdapterConfig` now accepts `adapter` (subprocess) XOR `callable` (module:function) - both backward-compatible and validated.
- **Local adapter backend** (`local_adapter_backend.py`) - uses a stdin/stdout JSON protocol per dataset row.
- `TargetEndpointConfig`, `LocalAdapterConfig`, `TargetConfig`, `BundleRef`, `DatasetRef`, `ExecutionConfig`, `RunMetadata`, `OutputConfig` Pydantic models.
- Bundle/dataset name-based resolution: `resolve_bundle_ref()` and `resolve_dataset_ref()` in `config_loader.py`.
- Config validation with actionable error messages for missing `version` or legacy `backend` key.
- `tests/fixtures/fake_adapter.py` - stdin/stdout JSON echo adapter for integration tests.

### Removed
- `SubprocessBackend` (replaced by `LocalAdapterBackend`).
- `agent_http_baseline` bundle (replaced by scenario-specific bundles with HTTP runs).

### Changed
- **Evaluation bundles refactored** - renamed to outcome-focused names and added explicit evaluator configs:
  - `model_direct_baseline` → `model_quality_baseline` - with explicit `config` (kind, class_name, input_mapping, score_keys) for all evaluators.
  - `rag_retrieval_baseline` → `rag_quality_baseline` - with explicit evaluator config.
  - `agent_tools_baseline` → `agent_workflow_baseline` - with explicit evaluator config.
- All run templates updated to reference new bundle names.

### Added
- `conversational_agent_baseline` bundle - CoherenceEvaluator, FluencyEvaluator, RelevanceEvaluator, SimilarityEvaluator for chatbots and Q&A agents.
- `safe_agent_baseline` bundle - ViolenceEvaluator, SexualEvaluator, SelfHarmEvaluator, HateUnfairnessEvaluator, ProtectedMaterialEvaluator for content safety and responsible AI. Uses `azure_ai_project` (auto-injected from `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`).
- Safety evaluator backend support - auto-injects `azure_ai_project` for safety evaluator classes, cloud evaluation data mapping, and default input mappings.
- `docs/bundles.md` - comprehensive bundle documentation with per-bundle sections, input mapping variables, and threshold reference.

### Added
- **HTTP backend** (`type: http`) - new evaluation backend for agents deployed outside Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, such as LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI SaaS, Microsoft Agent Framework applications on Azure Container Apps (ACA), or any custom REST endpoint.
  - Calls the agent endpoint row by row via HTTP POST.
  - Configurable via `url` (inline) or `url_env` (env var, recommended for CI).
  - Supports `request_field` (prompt key, default `message`), `response_field` (response key with dot-path support, default `text`), `auth_header_env` (Bearer token), and `headers` (static headers).
  - Supports `tool_calls_field` to extract tool call data from HTTP responses for agent-with-tools evaluators.
  - Supports `extra_fields` to forward additional JSONL row fields (e.g., `session_id`) in the request body.
  - Runs local evaluators (`exact_match`, `latency_seconds`, `avg_latency_seconds`) and AI-assisted foundry evaluators (via `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` / `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`).
  - All three scenarios (model-direct, RAG, agent-with-tools) supported via HTTP.
  - No Foundry Agent Service dependency - works for multi-agent scenarios where the orchestrator exposes an HTTP endpoint.
- Add `TargetEndpointConfig` fields for HTTP: `url`, `url_env`, `request_field`, `response_field`, `auth_header_env`, `headers`, `tool_calls_field`, `extra_fields`.
- **Enriched evaluation bundles** with comprehensive predefined evaluators:
  - `model_quality_baseline` - `SimilarityEvaluator`, `CoherenceEvaluator`, `FluencyEvaluator`, `F1ScoreEvaluator`.
  - `rag_quality_baseline` - `GroundednessEvaluator`, `RelevanceEvaluator`, `RetrievalEvaluator`, `ResponseCompletenessEvaluator`, `CoherenceEvaluator`.
  - `agent_workflow_baseline` - `TaskCompletionEvaluator`, `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator`, `IntentResolutionEvaluator`, `TaskAdherenceEvaluator`, `ToolSelectionEvaluator`, `ToolInputAccuracyEvaluator`.
- Expanded cloud evaluator mappings: `_EVALUATORS_NEEDING_CONTEXT` now includes `relevance` and `retrieval`; `_EVALUATORS_NEEDING_TOOL_CALLS` now includes `tool_selection`, `tool_input_accuracy`, `tool_output_utilization`, `tool_call_success`.
- Added default input mappings for all new evaluators in `_default_foundry_input_mapping()`.
- `agentops init` now scaffolds HTTP scenario starter files:
  - `run-http-model.yaml` - HTTP model-direct run config.
  - `run-http-rag.yaml` - HTTP RAG run config.
  - `run-http-agent-tools.yaml` - HTTP agent-with-tools run config (with `tool_calls_field`).
  - `bundles/agent_http_baseline.yaml` removed (replaced by scenario-specific bundles).
- Add `docs/tutorial-http-agent.md` - end-to-end tutorial for the Agent Framework / ACA scenario.
- Add unit tests for `HttpBackend` (`tests/unit/test_http_backend.py`): URL resolution, request field, dot-path response extraction, latency metrics, auth header, `backend_metrics.json` schema.

- Implement `agentops eval compare --runs <baseline>,<current>` for baseline comparison of evaluation runs.
  - Produces `comparison.json` (structured metric deltas, threshold flips, item-level changes) and `comparison.md` (human-readable report).
  - Exits with code `0` (no regressions), `2` (regressions detected), or `1` (error).
  - Supports run IDs by timestamped folder name, `latest` keyword, or absolute/relative paths.
- Add Pydantic models for comparison output: `ComparisonResult`, `MetricDelta`, `ThresholdDelta`, `ItemDelta`, `ComparisonSummary`.
- Add comparison service (`services/comparison.py`) with run discovery and structured diff logic.
- Update `agentops-regression` and `agentops-eval` Copilot skills to reference the new compare command.
- Add distributable Copilot skills under `.github/plugins/agentops/skills/` for GitHub-based installation (`agentops-eval`, `agentops-config`, `agentops-dataset`, `agentops-report`, `agentops-regression`, `agentops-trace`, `agentops-monitor`, `agentops-workflow`).
- Fix cloud evaluation to use the Foundry Project Evals API (`api-version=2025-11-15-preview`) with `azure_ai_evaluator` testing criteria, replacing the OpenAI SDK-based path that was incompatible.
- Fix metric polarity in comparison: lower-is-better metrics (e.g. `avg_latency_seconds` with `<=` threshold) now correctly show "improved" when they decrease.
- Align `azure-ai-projects` version references across all files to `>=2.0.1`.

### Changed
- Migrate versioning from static `pyproject.toml` field to `setuptools-scm` - version is now derived automatically from git tags.
- Redesign release pipeline into three workflow files:
  - `_build.yml` - reusable build workflow (test + package via setuptools-scm)
  - `staging.yml` - `release/*` branch pushes publish to TestPyPI and verify install
  - `release.yml` - `v*` tag pushes publish to TestPyPI, then PyPI (with approval gate), then create GitHub Release
- Add CLI smoke test in staging/release verify step (`agentops --version`, `agentops --help`, `agentops init`).
- Fix secret reference from `PIPY_TOKEN` to `PYPI_TOKEN`; add `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN` for TestPyPI.
- Add consistent workflow index header across all CI/CD workflow files.
- Add VSIX extension packaging and publishing to CI/CD pipeline; include Copilot skills in the VS Code Marketplace extension.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-__-__

### Added
- `DatasetFormat.context_field` - optional field to declare the JSONL column holding retrieved context documents; used by `GroundednessEvaluator` in both cloud and local evaluation modes.
- `TaskCompletionEvaluator` support in the Foundry backend: default `input_mapping` and cloud `data_mapping` for both cloud and local modes.
- `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` support in the Foundry backend: `_EVALUATORS_NEEDING_TOOL_CALLS` set, cloud `data_mapping` (maps `tool_calls` from `{{sample.tool_calls}}` and `tool_definitions` from `{{item.tool_definitions}}`), and local `input_mapping`.
- `agent_workflow_baseline` bundle upgraded from `SimilarityEvaluator` placeholder to `TaskCompletionEvaluator` + `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` with matching thresholds.
- `smoke-agent-tools.jsonl` enriched with `tool_definitions` and `tool_calls` fields for all 5 rows.
- Unit tests covering `_cloud_evaluator_data_mapping` (context_field, task_completion, tool_call_accuracy) and `_default_foundry_input_mapping` (GroundednessEvaluator, TaskCompletionEvaluator, ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator).

### Fixed
- `GroundednessEvaluator` in cloud mode now maps `context` to `{{item.<context_field>}}` when `context_field` is set in the dataset format, instead of incorrectly using the `expected_field` column.
- `GroundednessEvaluator` in local mode now maps `context` to `$row.context` (the retrieved documents column) instead of `$expected` (the ground truth answer).
- `smoke-rag.yaml` dataset config now declares `context_field: context` to correctly wire the `context` JSONL column to groundedness evaluation.

### Changed
- Split `agentops init` dataset seeds into `.agentops/datasets/` for YAML definitions and `.agentops/data/` for JSONL rows, and updated docs/examples to use the new layout.
- Expanded `agentops init` run-config seeds to include scenario-specific examples: `.agentops/run-rag.yaml` and `.agentops/run-agent.yaml` in addition to the default `.agentops/run.yaml`.
- Removed the runtime fallback to `gpt-5-mini` in the Foundry backend; model-direct mode now requires an explicit deployment via `backend.model` or `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
- Added planned CLI command stubs with friendly "not implemented in this release" messages, and documented command availability/status in README and architecture docs.
- Reworked `README.md` into a walkthrough-oriented structure with a clearer overview, step-by-step onboarding flow, command status table, and documentation map.
- Refined `README.md` messaging to position AgentOps as a broader operations foundation (evaluation + planned CI/CD, tracing, observability, and monitoring capabilities), and renamed the onboarding section to `Quickstart`.

### Fixed
- Align README quickstart workspace tree and starter bundle table with current `agentops init` templates (`model_quality_baseline`, `rag_quality_baseline`, `conversational_agent_baseline`, `agent_workflow_baseline`, and smoke datasets).

### Added
- CLI command surface with Typer stubs:
  - `agentops init`
  - `agentops eval run --config <run.yaml> [--output <dir>]`
  - `agentops report --in <results.json> [--out <report.md>]`
- Unit tests for models, YAML/config loading, and workspace initialization behavior.
- Initial documentation including generic quickstart and test running guide.
