# How It Works

This document is the single source of truth for understanding the AgentOps architecture. Read it before making any changes.

## What Is AgentOps?

AgentOps is a **standalone Python CLI, local Cockpit, and skill set** that helps
teams answer the Foundry release question: **can we ship this agent, and where
is the proof?** It:

1. Reads the flat `agentops.yaml` configuration plus JSONL dataset rows.
2. Executes evaluation against a target (Foundry agent, model deployment, HTTP endpoint, or local adapter).
3. Produces normalized outputs: `results.json` (machine-readable) and `report.md` (human-readable).
4. Returns CI-friendly exit codes: `0` pass, `2` threshold failure, `1` error.
5. Writes release evidence with `agentops doctor --evidence-pack`.

Foundry owns agent creation, deployment, runtime, traces, monitoring,
red-teaming, datasets, and Microsoft-hosted evaluation drilldown. AgentOps
references the candidate those tools produced and adds the repo-controlled
release proof:
config, gates, artifacts, PR reports, Doctor diagnostics, release evidence,
trace-to-regression promotion, and Cockpit links back to Foundry/Azure Monitor.

### Key Principles

| Principle | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| **Thin CLI** | `cli/app.py` parses args and delegates to services. |
| **Core is pure** | `core/` transforms data without Azure imports or network calls. |
| **Lazy Azure imports** | Azure SDK imports stay inside runtime functions. |
| **Pydantic v2** | YAML configs and JSON outputs use Pydantic models. |
| **pathlib.Path only** | No raw string paths anywhere in the codebase. |
| **No global state** | No singletons, no module-level side effects. |

## Request Flow (eval run)

For an unfamiliar repo, run `agentops eval analyze` first. It is a read-only
triage step: it inspects `agentops.yaml`, dataset columns, and local project
signals, then tells you whether `agentops eval run` is ready or whether Copilot
should use `agentops-config`, `agentops-dataset`, or `agentops-eval` to adapt
the setup.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["agentops init"] --> B["agentops eval analyze"]
    B --> C{"Eval setup ready?"}
    C -->|yes| D["agentops eval run"]
    C -->|no / complex| E["Copilot + AgentOps skills"]
    E --> F["agentops-config / agentops-dataset / agentops-eval"]
    F --> B
    D --> G["results.json + report.md"]
    G --> H["agentops workflow analyze"]
    H --> I{"CI/CD shape clear?"}
    I -->|yes| J["workflow generate --deploy-mode auto"]
    I -->|complex accelerator| K["Copilot + agentops-workflow"]
    J --> L["Deterministic CI/CD"]
    K --> L
    L --> M["agentops doctor"]
    M --> N["doctor --evidence-pack"]
    N --> O["agentops cockpit"]
```

For AI Landing Zone projects, `workflow analyze` surfaces the official
`scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.ps1` path when present. Generated azd workflows
run that preflight before `azd provision`, and Doctor reports AI Landing Zone
deployment readiness under Operational Excellence so teams can see whether
preflight, eval config, workflow deployment, and private-network runner planning
are wired together.

When you run `agentops eval run`, the following happens step by step:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["CLI parses args"] --> B["Load agentops.yaml"]
    B --> C["classify_agent"]
    C --> D["Pre-flight checks"]
    D --> E{"execution mode"}
    E -->|local/cloud| DS{"Local path or Azure Storage URL?"}
    DS -->|local| F["Read JSONL dataset"]
    DS -->|Blob / ADLS| RS["Resolve one bounded temporary snapshot"]
    RS --> F
    F --> G["Invoke target per row or submit Foundry cloud eval"]
    G --> H["Run/collect evaluator scores"]
    E -->|azd| AZD["Call azd (ai eval or ai agent eval) using the discovered recipe"]
    AZD --> H
    H --> I["Evaluate thresholds"]
    I --> J["Write results.json + report.md"]
    J --> K["Sync .agentops/results/latest"]
    K --> L{"Publish configured?"}
    L -->|Classic| M["Upload local metrics to Foundry"]
    L -->|Cloud| N["Submit server-side Foundry eval"]
    L -->|No| O["Return exit code"]
    M --> O
    N --> O
```

Exit codes are `0` when all thresholds pass, `2` when one or more thresholds
fail, and `1` for runtime or configuration errors.

For AgentOps-owned local, cloud, official-evaluation, and readiness-analysis
paths, `dataset` may identify a local JSONL file or one canonical Blob/ADLS Gen2
HTTPS object. The pure core parser validates the untouched scalar before
`pathlib.Path` coercion, which preserves URLs on Windows. The service layer then
uses the process's existing Azure identity to stream one object of at most
100 MiB into a private temporary file. Existing readers consume that stable
snapshot, while results, reports, telemetry, and cloud lineage retain the
validated remote URI. Temporary files are cleaned after the operation.

Local users authenticate with `az login`; automation uses its existing
federated, workload, managed, or service-principal identity. The identity needs
`Storage Blob Data Reader`, plus any required ADLS path ACLs. Dataset-specific
tokens, SAS, account keys, connection strings, query strings, fragments, and
embedded credentials are unsupported. Storage firewall and private-endpoint
connectivity remain runner responsibilities. `execution: azd` is unchanged and
continues to use the dataset declared by the azd recipe.

### The two azd evaluation surfaces

`execution: azd` supports two azd command families. The discovered recipe
decides which one runs; there is no extra setting.

| Recipe | azd commands | Extension |
|---|---|---|
| `evals/azure.eval.yaml` | `azd ai eval` | `azure.ai.evaluations` (preview, azd 1.27.1+) |
| `eval.yaml`, `src/<agent>/eval.yaml` | `azd ai agent eval` | `azure.ai.agents` |

Recipes are classified by content rather than filename, and when both surfaces
are discoverable the current one wins with the skipped recipe reported.

For the current surface AgentOps reconciles the evaluation definition, submits
the run without waiting, polls it to a terminal state under its own timeout, and
then reads the run object plus every per-sample output item. Submitting without
waiting is deliberate: azd's blocking mode has an internal wait budget that, on
expiry, exits zero with an unfinished run and a differently shaped payload.

AgentOps computes aggregate metrics itself for that surface, because the azd run
object exposes only counts, never scores. It also never passes a failure-gating
flag to azd — the release gate stays in AgentOps so a gate breach remains
distinguishable from an operational failure.

## POC-to-production readiness flow

AgentOps does not create a second production gate with a new exit-code
contract. Instead, it projects the signals already produced by evals, Doctor,
workflow files, Foundry control-plane checks, Azure Monitor, AI Landing Zone
readiness, trace-regression manifests, and optional governance artifacts
(ASSERT, ACS, red-team evidence indexes) into a release evidence pack:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E["eval run"] --> R["results.json/report.md"]
    R --> D["doctor"]
    D --> P["doctor --evidence-pack"]
    T["exported Foundry/App Insights traces"] --> PT["eval promote-traces --apply"]
    PT --> M["trace-regression-manifest.json"]
    M --> P
    W["workflow generate"] --> P
    G["ASSERT / ACS / red-team evidence paths"] --> P
    P --> J["evidence.json/evidence.md"]
```

- `evidence.json` is the stable machine-readable contract (`version: 1`).
- `evidence.md` is the PR/release-review summary.
- `ready`, `ready_with_warnings`, and `blocked` are projections of existing
  signals; eval and Doctor exit codes remain unchanged.
- Trace promotion is local and review-first. `self-similarity` labels are useful
  for drift detection, not human-verified correctness; use `--label-mode pending`
  when a person must fill expected answers before the dataset can gate.
- Governance artifacts are evidence-only references. AgentOps records path,
  SHA-256 hash, file size, schema version when available, and ACS checkpoint
  coverage; it does not execute ASSERT, apply ACS controls, configure Guided
  Guardrails, or run red-team campaigns.

## Analyze / Generate Boundary

The `analyze` commands are intentionally deterministic and local-only. They do
not call models, Copilot, Azure, Foundry, GitHub, or Azure DevOps. Their job is
to say whether the next deterministic command is safe or whether the user should
ask Copilot to apply the matching skill.

When a skill handoff is needed, the analysis output keeps it copy/pasteable:
it reports whether AgentOps Copilot skills are installed in the repo, suggests
`agentops skills install --platform copilot` when they are missing, and prints a
single prompt to paste into Copilot.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    EA["eval analyze"] --> ER["eval run"]
    EA --> ES["Copilot skills when setup is ambiguous"]
    ES --> ER
    WA["workflow analyze"] --> WG["workflow generate"]
    WA --> WS["Copilot workflow skill when deployment is project-specific"]
    ER --> WA
    WG --> CI["Deterministic CI/CD"]
    WS --> CI
```

## Exit Code Contract

Exit codes are part of the public API. **Do not change their meaning.**

| `2` | Execution succeeded **but** one or more thresholds failed |
| `1` | Runtime or configuration error |

## User Workspace Structure (`agentops.yaml` + `.agentops/`)

The flat 1.0 schema places **one config file** at the project root and a
small directory for datasets, local environment values, run history, and
(optionally) skills. `agentops init` writes AgentOps-owned local Azure values to
`.agentops/.env` by default. Existing or explicitly requested azd workspaces
continue to use `.azure/<env>/.env`.

```

The legacy layered layout (`.agentops/config.yaml` + `bundles/` +
`datasets/*.yaml` + `run.yaml`) **no longer exists**. The new schema is
declared by [src/agentops/core/agentops_config.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/core/agentops_config.py)
and rejects any of the legacy top-level keys (`target`, `bundle`,
`execution`, `output`, `scenario`, `backend`, `run`) at parse time with
an actionable error.

## `agentops.yaml` (flat 1.0 schema)

### Minimal config

The minimum is three lines:

```yaml
version: 1
agent: my-rag:3
dataset: ./qa.jsonl
```

That's a complete config. AgentOps:

* Resolves `agent` into one of four target kinds (see below).
* Auto-selects evaluators from the dataset row shape (presence of
  `context`, `tool_calls`, `tool_definitions`).
* Applies sensible default thresholds from the evaluator catalog.

### Top-level fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | Schema version. Must be `1`. |
| `agent` | no | Target identifier. See "Target kinds" below. Omit it to run in project-observability-only mode (Doctor and Cockpit against the Foundry project with no evaluation target). Required for `eval run`, `prompt pull`, and the azd eval paths. |
| `dataset` | yes | Relative/absolute JSONL path, or canonical Blob/ADLS Gen2 HTTPS object URL, with one evaluation row per line. |
| `thresholds` | no | Metric gates such as `">=3"` or `"<=10"`. |
| `protocol` | no | URL protocol: `responses`, `invocations`, or `http-json`. |
| `request_field` / `response_field` / `tool_calls_field` | no | Request/response JSON keys or dot-paths. |
| `headers` | no | Static HTTP headers (dict). |
| `auth_header_env` | no | Env var name holding a Bearer token. |
| `evaluators` | no | Escape-hatch list of evaluator names that overrides auto-selection. |
| `publish` | no | Boolean. With `execution: local`, `true` uploads local metrics to Classic Foundry. With `execution: cloud`, publishing is implicit. |
| `execution` | no | `local` (default) runs through AgentOps locally. `cloud` runs a Foundry prompt agent server-side through the OpenAI Evals API. |
| `project_endpoint` | no | Foundry project URL used by Foundry invocation and publishing. Falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`. |
| `dataset_sync` | no | Cloud-evaluation dataset policy: `auto`, `foundry`, or `inline`. |

### Target kinds

`classify_agent()` resolves `agent` into one of four kinds based on shape:

| Kind | Trigger | Example `agent` value |
|---|---|---|
| `foundry_prompt` | `name:version` | `my-rag:3` |
| `foundry_hosted` | URL on a Foundry domain | `https://contoso.services.ai.azure.com/.../agents/<id>` |
| `http_json` | Any other HTTPS URL | `https://my-aca-app.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/chat` |
| `model_direct` | `model:<deployment>` | `model:gpt-4o-mini` |

The kind drives both invocation strategy (`pipeline/invocations.py`) and
which fields make sense (e.g. `protocol` is rejected for
`foundry_prompt` and `model_direct`).

Foundry Prompt Agents are created and versioned by Foundry. Foundry Hosted
Agents are deployed endpoints on a Foundry domain. AgentOps evaluates both, but
it does not replace the Foundry Toolkit, Foundry SDK, `microsoft-foundry` skill,
or azd paths that create and deploy them.

### Examples

**Foundry prompt agent (RAG evaluators auto-selected from dataset rows):**

```yaml
version: 1
agent: my-rag:3
dataset: .agentops/data/qa.jsonl
thresholds:
  groundedness: ">=3"
  coherence: ">=3"
  avg_latency_seconds: "<=10"
publish: true         # local run, then upload metrics to Classic Foundry
```

**HTTP-deployed agent (LangGraph / ACA / custom REST):**

```yaml
version: 1
agent: https://my-aca-app.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/chat
dataset: .agentops/data/qa.jsonl
request_field: message            # default is "message"
response_field: text              # dot-path; default is "text"
auth_header_env: APP_API_TOKEN    # value used as Bearer token
```

**Raw model deployment:**

```yaml
version: 1
agent: model:gpt-4o-mini
dataset: .agentops/data/qa.jsonl
thresholds:
  similarity: ">=4"
  avg_latency_seconds: "<=8"
```

**Run in New Foundry server-side (preview):**

```yaml
version: 1
agent: my-rag:3                   # name:version is required for cloud mode
dataset: .agentops/data/qa.jsonl
execution: cloud
# project_endpoint: "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<p>"
```

## Datasets

A dataset is a plain JSONL file. One row per line. No companion YAML.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | string | The prompt sent to the target. |
| `expected` | string | Ground-truth response used by reference-based evaluators. |

Optional fields drive evaluator auto-selection:

| Field | Triggers |
|---|---|
| `context` | RAG evaluators |
| `tool_calls` + `tool_definitions` | Tool-use evaluators |

Example RAG row:

```json
{
  "input": "What is the refund policy?",
  "expected": "Refunds within 30 days.",
  "context": "Our policy: refunds are available within 30 days."
}
```

### Local JSONL vs Foundry Data/Datasets

The JSONL file referenced by `dataset:` is the AgentOps source of truth. It
belongs in your repo, participates in code review, and is what local and CI
runs read.

When `execution: cloud` is used, Foundry executes the eval server-side.
By default, AgentOps syncs the local JSONL to a stable Foundry dataset version
and passes that dataset id to the OpenAI Evals API as `source: file_id`. The
Foundry dataset name defaults to `agentops-<jsonl-stem>` and the version
defaults to a content-hash prefix, so unchanged data is reused and changed data
creates a new version.

The inline compatibility path is still available with
`dataset_sync.mode: inline`. In that mode, Foundry can materialize inline rows
as backing project assets named like `eval-data-*` in **Data > Datasets**. Those
assets are cloud-eval artifacts, not separate hand-authored AgentOps datasets.

AgentOps records this lineage in `cloud_evaluation.json`:

```json
{
  "dataset": {
    "mode": "foundry",
    "requested_mode": "auto",
    "source_type": "file_id",
    "local_path": ".agentops/data/smoke.jsonl",
    "sha256": "...",
    "foundry_name": "agentops-smoke",
    "foundry_version": "sha256-..."
  }
}
```

You can pin the Foundry dataset identity or force inline compatibility:

```yaml
dataset: .agentops/data/smoke.jsonl
dataset_sync:
  mode: auto                  # auto | foundry | inline
  name: agentops-smoke
  version: content-hash
```

Use `dataset_sync.mode: foundry` when a pipeline must fail rather than fall
back to inline data if dataset upload/reuse fails. Use
`dataset_sync.mode: inline` for quick experiments or environments that do not
have permission to create Foundry datasets.

## Evaluator auto-selection

The catalog is defined in [src/agentops/core/evaluators.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/core/evaluators.py).
Selection rules (in order):

1. If `evaluators:` is set in `agentops.yaml`, use it verbatim (escape hatch).
2. Otherwise, start from the **quality baseline** for the resolved target
   kind. Prompt/hosted agents use judge-based answer quality
   (`Coherence + Fluency + Similarity + ResponseCompleteness`); raw
   `model:<deployment>` targets also add exact-reference overlap (`F1Score`).
3. If dataset rows include `context`, add the **RAG evaluator set**
   (`Groundedness`, `Relevance`, `Retrieval`, `ResponseCompleteness`).
4. If rows include `tool_calls` + `tool_definitions`, add the **tool-use
   evaluator set** (`ToolCallAccuracy`, `IntentResolution`, `TaskAdherence`, …).
5. `avg_latency_seconds` is always included as a runtime metric.

### Recommended judge models

AI-assisted evaluators use an LLM as a judge. Use instruction-following
models like `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`. **Avoid
reasoning models** (`o1`, `o3`, `o4`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-nano`) - they are
slower, more expensive, and may not follow the evaluator prompt format.

Set the deployment via env vars before running:

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.openai.azure.com/"
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o-mini"
```

| `">=3"`, `">3"`, `"<=10"`, `"<10"`, `"==1"` | Numeric comparison |
| `"true"` / `"false"` | Boolean expectation (used by safety evaluators) |
| Raw number `3` | Shorthand for `>=3` |

Each row is judged against every applicable threshold. A row passes only
if every threshold passes. The run passes only if every row passes
(this is the only condition that maps to exit code `0`; otherwise `2`).

## Publishing to Foundry Evaluations

`execution:` decides where the run happens. `publish:` controls Foundry
visibility for local runs. AgentOps always writes `results.json` and
`report.md`; cloud runs also write `cloud_evaluation.json` with the Foundry
link.

| Config | What runs | Foundry visibility | Targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execution: local`, `publish: false` | AgentOps invokes target and evaluators locally | None; local artifacts only | Any target |
| `execution: local`, `publish: true` | AgentOps local run, then metric upload | Classic Foundry Evaluations panel | Any target |
| `execution: cloud` | Foundry runs agent + evaluators server-side through the OpenAI Evals API | New Foundry Evaluations panel; publish is implicit | Foundry Prompt Agent (`name:version`) or Foundry Hosted Agent URL containing `/agents/<name>/versions/<version>` |

Foundry-visible modes:

* Require either `project_endpoint` in `agentops.yaml` or
  `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in the environment.
* Authenticate with `DefaultAzureCredential` (passwordless: `az login`,
  managed identity, or service principal).
* Write `cloud_evaluation.json` next to `results.json` containing
  `mode` (`classic` or `cloud`), `evaluation_name`, `report_url`, and
  (for cloud execution) the `eval_id` / `run_id` / terminal `status`.

The `execution: cloud` trade-offs (so you can decide consciously):

* Foundry-side latency replaces the locally-measured wall-clock latency.
* Judges are opaque (Foundry-managed); custom evaluators are skipped.
* The dataset is synced to Foundry Data/Datasets by default. Inline
  compatibility remains available and may show `eval-data-*` backing assets.
* Evaluator runs cost against your Azure OpenAI deployment.
* Polling adds ~5 s × N to the total wall-clock time.

For prompt-agent CI pipelines, AgentOps cloud eval is the default gate when the
repo needs artifacts, baselines, Doctor readiness, or release evidence. Foundry
executes the managed eval; AgentOps enforces thresholds and writes the proof
pack. The standalone Microsoft Foundry AI Agent Evaluation GitHub Action or
Azure DevOps extension remains useful for platform-native validation outside the
AgentOps release-readiness flow.

Implementation lives in [src/agentops/pipeline/publisher.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/pipeline/publisher.py)
(Classic) and [src/agentops/pipeline/cloud_runner.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/pipeline/cloud_runner.py)
(New Foundry). Dispatch happens in
[src/agentops/pipeline/orchestrator.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/pipeline/orchestrator.py).

## Pre-flight checks

`agentops doctor` and `agentops cockpit` run a short pre-flight before doing
real work. It lives in
[src/agentops/services/preflight.py](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/blob/main/src/agentops/services/preflight.py)
and reports **all** rows at once instead of stopping at the first problem:

* **Workspace** — the target directory is a usable AgentOps workspace.
* **Azure authentication** — `DefaultAzureCredential` acquires an ARM token
  within 30 s (`process_timeout=30` is set to absorb Windows `az.cmd` cold
  starts).
* **Foundry project** — the configured project endpoint is reachable.
* **Application Insights** — a connection string is available, either
  auto-discovered from Foundry or set through
  `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`.

Each check is a single best-effort attempt with no retries, and a failing
check never raises into the CLI. The default policy is advisory: warnings
print and the command continues. For CI gating, pass `--strict-preflight`
to `agentops doctor` so any failure exits non-zero. Pass `--no-preflight`
to `doctor` or `cockpit` to skip the checks entirely.

## Invocation strategies (target kind → wire call)

There is no longer a free-form `backend:` field. The invocation
strategy is derived from the target kind resolved by `classify_agent()`:

| Target kind | Invocation strategy |
|---|---|
| `foundry_prompt` | Foundry Agent Service threads/runs API via `AIProjectClient` |
| `foundry_hosted` | Direct call to the hosted endpoint with the configured `protocol` |
| `http_json` | POST `{request_field: input, ...}` and extract `response_field` (dot-path) |
| `model_direct` | Azure OpenAI chat completions via `AIProjectClient.get_openai_client()` |

`AIProjectClient.get_openai_client()` is **always called without
`api_version`** - passing one explicitly has historically caused 404s
in this codebase.

## How evaluators and metrics work

- Evaluator execution is row-first:
  - each dataset row is evaluated and can produce one or more row scores.
- Threshold evaluation is config-driven:
  - each entry in `thresholds:` maps an evaluator's score key to a comparison expression
  - each row receives a verdict per threshold
  - a row passes only if every applicable threshold passes
  - run-level threshold status is consolidated from item verdicts.
- Metrics have three levels in `results.json`:
  - `metrics`: backend/global metrics (already aggregated)
  - `row_metrics`: per-row evaluator outputs (`row_index` + metric list + optional `input`/`response` text)
  - `item_evaluations`: per-row threshold verdicts (per evaluator + final row PASS/FAIL)
  - `run_metrics`: consolidated execution metrics derived by AgentOps

In short:
- evaluator computes score per item
- threshold validates expected quality policy per item and per run
- AgentOps consolidates visibility for CI and reporting

## Consolidated run metrics

- AgentOps derives consolidated run metrics for each execution in `results.json` under `run_metrics`.
- Derived by default:
  - `run_pass` (`1.0` pass, `0.0` fail)
  - `threshold_pass_rate` (`thresholds_passed / thresholds_count`)
  - `items_total`
  - `items_passed_all`
  - `items_failed_any`
  - `items_pass_rate`
  - per-metric aggregates from row data, for example:
    - `groundedness_avg`
    - `groundedness_stddev`
    - `latency_seconds_avg`
    - `latency_seconds_stddev`
  - `accuracy` (from row-level `exact_match` average when available)

## Outputs and history

- Every run writes its artifacts to `.agentops/results/<timestamp>/` (immutable history).
- AgentOps then refreshes `.agentops/results/latest/` with a copy of that run, so `latest/` always points at the most recent results.
- Pass `--output <dir>` to skip the default layout and write only to that path (useful for named baselines or CI artifacts).
- `results.json`: normalized, machine-readable result for CI/automation.
- `report.md`: human-readable summary for review.

When you run:

```bash
agentops eval run
```

AgentOps writes to both:

- `.agentops/results/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS/` (immutable history of that run)
- `.agentops/results/latest/` (convenient pointer to last run content)

If you pass `--output`, AgentOps writes to that directory and still updates `.agentops/results/latest/` with the newest run content.

### Regression commit attribution

Every run's `results.json` also carries a `commit` field (SHA, subject,
author, timestamp) when it can be determined - reliably in CI (via the same
`GITHUB_SHA`/`BUILD_SOURCEVERSION` environment variables already used for
Foundry prompt-agent deploy gating), and on a best-effort basis locally via
`git rev-parse HEAD`. It's `null` when the workspace isn't a git repository
or `git` is unavailable; nothing else about the run changes.

When one or more metrics regress between two comparable runs (same agent
target, dataset, and evaluator set) that both have commit metadata -
whether detected via an explicit `--baseline` comparison or Doctor's
rolling regression check - `report.md` gains a "Regression Insight" section
listing every metric that regressed (not just the worst one) and explaining
what changed between the two commits (system prompt, model, dataset,
evaluators, or thresholds) and suggesting a corrective action. When either
run was published to Foundry (`execution: cloud`, or local `publish: true`),
the section also links out to its Evaluations page. This is deterministic
field-diffing, not an LLM call, and it's purely informational: it never
affects the exit-code/threshold-gating contract. Runs without commit
metadata, or where nothing tracked changed, behave exactly as they did
before this existed.

Every run produced by `agentops eval run` - including `execution: cloud`
and `execution: azd` - attempts commit capture. The one case with no commit
to attribute is Doctor's rolling regression check when it falls back to
Foundry cloud evaluation runs because local history is too short (see
`results_history`'s cloud fallback): those runs have no local
`results.json` to reload and therefore no recorded commit. When that
happens, the regression finding's recommendation says so explicitly (e.g.
`attribution unavailable: run has no commit (fetched from cloud)`) instead
of silently omitting the insight.

Cockpit's dashboard also gains an "Evaluation Version History" section
listing every locally recorded run, newest first, with its commit, which
metrics (if any) regressed relative to the previous run in its lineage by
name, and what changed - shown regardless of whether that run regressed, so
you can browse the causal trail over time.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/` and are organized as:

```
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   ├── fake_eval_runner.py          # Fake backend for integration tests
│   └── fake_adapter.py              # Fake local adapter (stdin/stdout JSON echo)
├── integration/
│   └── test_eval_run_integration.py # End-to-end via local adapter backend
└── unit/
    ├── test_models.py               # Pydantic model validation
    ├── test_reporter.py             # Threshold evaluation + report
    ├── test_yaml_loader.py          # YAML loading + env-var interpolation
    ├── test_foundry_backend.py      # Foundry backend helpers (mocked)
    ├── test_http_backend.py         # HTTP backend helpers
    └── test_initializer.py          # Workspace scaffolding
```

Run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -x -q
```

Key testing rules:
- All Azure SDK calls must be **mocked** - tests run without Azure credentials.
- Tests must assert correct **exit codes** (0, 1, 2).
- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/`, integration tests in `tests/integration/`.

## Dependencies

Declared in `pyproject.toml`:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `typer` | CLI framework |
| `pydantic` (v2) | Config and results schema validation |
| `ruamel.yaml` | YAML parsing with env-var interpolation |

**Runtime Azure dependencies** (installed by the user, not declared in `pyproject.toml`):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `azure-ai-projects` | Foundry project client, `get_openai_client()` |
| `azure-ai-evaluation` | Local evaluator classes (SimilarityEvaluator, etc.) |
| `azure-identity` | `DefaultAzureCredential` authentication |
| `openai` | OpenAI Evals API types |

Azure SDK dependencies are kept separate so the CLI stays lightweight and tests can run without cloud credentials.

## Quick Reference for New Contributors

1. **Install in dev mode**: `uv sync --group dev`. `dev` is a PEP 735 dependency group, not an extra, so `pip install -e ".[dev]"` does not install it: pip warns about an unknown extra and installs the project without the dev tools. With pip, use `pip install -e ".[agent,mcp]"` and add test tools yourself. See the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. **Run tests**: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -x -q`. `uv sync` populates `.venv` but does not activate it, so a bare `python` may be the system interpreter. `uv run` is what CI uses. If you prefer, activate `.venv` first and then call `python` directly.
3. **Try it out**: `uv run agentops init` then explore `.agentops/`
4. **Read the models**: `core/models.py` is the best single file to understand all data structures
5. **Follow the flow**: `cli/app.py` → `services/runner.py` → `backends/` → `core/`
6. **Keep CLI thin**: never put logic in `cli/app.py` - delegate to `services/`
7. **Keep core pure**: never import Azure SDK in `core/` - that belongs in `backends/` and `services/`
