# Release Management

## Purpose
Guide contributors and maintainers through the AgentOps branching strategy, versioning conventions, changelog lifecycle, and PyPI release process.

## When to Use
- User asks what branch to base work on or where to raise a PR.
- User asks how to create a feature or release branch.
- User asks how to prepare a release or cut a version.
- User asks how to update the changelog.
- User asks how to tag a version or publish to PyPI.
- User asks how to sync their fork after a release.
- Instructions about branching or versioning are ambiguous.

## Branching Model

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Always stable and deployment-ready. Only receives merges from `release/vx.y.z` branches. |
| `develop` | Integration branch. All feature PRs target here. |
| `release/vx.y.z` | Created by maintainers from `develop` when a release is ready to ship. |
| `feature/<name>` | Created by contributors from `develop` for all new work. |

**Default rule:** unless explicitly told otherwise, all work starts from `develop`.

## Feature Development Workflow

### Branch naming
```
feature/<short-description>
```
Examples: `feature/conversation-metadata`, `feature/add-evaluation-logging`

### Flow
1. Start from `develop`
2. Create `feature/<name>`
3. Implement changes
4. Commit with [conventional commit messages](#commit-guidelines)
5. Open PR → `develop`

### PR contract
- Source: `feature/*`
- Target: `develop`
- Never open a feature PR directly to `main`

## Release Workflow (Maintainers)

### Release branch naming
```
release/vx.y.z
```
Examples: `release/v2.4.2`, `release/v0.2.0`

### Flow

**Preferred: One-click via Cut Release workflow**
1. Confirm `develop` is green (CI passes) and all intended changes are merged.
2. Go to **Actions** tab → **Cut Release** → **Run workflow** → enter version (e.g. `0.2.0`, no `v` prefix).
3. The workflow automatically:
   - Creates `release/v0.2.0` from `develop`
   - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` (adds versioned section `[0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`)
   - Pushes the branch (triggers staging pipeline automatically)
   - Opens a PR: `release/v0.2.0` → `main`
4. Wait for staging to pass (build → TestPyPI → verify, plus parallel `build-vsix`).
   Download and manually evaluate the pre-release VSIX artifact. Staging uploads
   Python to TestPyPI but never uploads to Marketplace or reserves a Marketplace
   version. No Marketplace environment or approval is required during staging.
5. Get the PR reviewed and merge into `main`.
6. Tag the release on `main` **and sync `develop` in the same sitting**. Tagging
   publishes to PyPI immediately; there is no approval prompt. Leaving `develop`
   behind `main` corrupts the next release's CHANGELOG.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin v0.2.0

   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git merge main
   git push origin develop

   # MUST print nothing:
   git fetch origin && git log --oneline origin/develop..origin/main
   ```
   After the merge, open `CHANGELOG.md` and confirm everything under
   `## [Unreleased]` is genuinely unreleased. Git happily places the incoming
   `## [0.2.0]` heading above develop's unreleased entries, nesting new work
   inside a shipped version.
7. Watch the Release workflow finish (build → TestPyPI → verify → publish-pypi →
   publish-vsix → github-release). The Python `release` environment has no
   protection rules: Python publishes **before Marketplace approval**. A human
   must approve `marketplace-release` for stable extension publication; do not
   bypass that gate. GitHub Release waits for successful Marketplace publication.
8. Delete the release branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete release/v0.2.0
   git branch -d release/v0.2.0
   ```

**Alternative: Manual release branch creation**
1. Confirm `develop` is green.
2. Create release branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/v0.2.0
   ```
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` - see [Changelog Lifecycle](#changelog-lifecycle) below.
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release 0.2.0"
   git push origin release/v0.2.0
   ```
   This triggers the staging pipeline automatically.
5. Open PR: `release/v0.2.0` → `main`.
6. After staging passes and review is complete, merge to `main`.
7. Tag and push, then immediately sync `develop` and verify with
   `git log --oneline origin/develop..origin/main` (must be empty). Pushing the
   tag publishes to PyPI with no approval prompt. Same commands and same
   CHANGELOG check as step 6 above.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```
8. Delete the release branch (same as above).

### Release PR contract
- Source: `release/vx.y.z`
- Target: `main`
- Do NOT introduce new feature work in a release branch - only changelog updates.

## Versioning Rules

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `PATCH` | Bug fixes and minor backward-compatible improvements |
| `MINOR` | New backward-compatible features |
| `MAJOR` | Breaking changes to the CLI contract or output schema |

Version numbers follow a consistent pattern across artifacts. The git tag and GitHub Release use a `v` prefix. The release branch also uses the `v` prefix. Versioning is fully automatic via **setuptools-scm** - there is no `version` field in `pyproject.toml`.

| Artifact | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Release branch | `release/vx.y.z` | `release/v2.4.2` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `dynamic = ["version"]` | Version derived from git tags via setuptools-scm |
| Git tag / GitHub Release | `vx.y.z` | `v2.4.2` |
| Changelog heading | `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` | `## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-22` |

**Never add `version = "..."` to `pyproject.toml`** - this will conflict with setuptools-scm.

### Version on `develop`
- The version on `develop` is derived automatically by setuptools-scm (e.g., `0.1.3.dev12`).
- Do NOT preemptively bump any version on `develop` for an upcoming release.
- Feature branches should not modify `pyproject.toml` version.

## Changelog Lifecycle

The changelog follows a two-phase lifecycle: development on `develop`, finalization on `release/vx.y.z`.

### Development phase (`develop`)
- Add all user-visible changes under the next versioned section at the top of the changelog.
- Do NOT preemptively assign a future version number on `develop`.
- Do NOT create empty version sections.

```markdown
## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- New orchestration strategy for multi-turn evaluations.

### Fixed
- Corrected resource cleanup order in Foundry backend shutdown.
```

### Release phase (`release/vx.y.z`)
When creating the release branch, the cut-release workflow inserts a versioned section header with the release date. Verify the changelog entries are correct and complete.

All release artifacts must be in sync:

| Artifact | Value |
|---|---|
| Release branch | `release/v2.4.2` |
| Changelog heading | `## [2.4.2] - YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Git tag / GitHub Release | `v2.4.2` |

### Changelog sections
Use when applicable: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Deprecated`, `Security`.

### Writing style
- Start each entry with a **bold title**, followed by a brief technical explanation.
- Explain what changed and why it matters - include relevant technical context.
- Avoid vague wording: no "minor updates", "improvements", or "fixes" as standalone entries.

### Safety rules
- Never assign a release version on `develop` prematurely.
- Never leave a release branch without a properly dated versioned entry.
- Never mismatch version numbers across branch name, changelog, and tag.
- Never leave `develop` behind `main` after a release. `cut-release.yml` branches
  from `develop` and replaces the `## [Unreleased]` marker exactly once, so a
  stale `develop` republishes shipped entries and drops the previous version's
  section when the next release PR merges into `main`.

## Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```
feat: add conversation metadata support
fix: correct chat history persistence issue
docs: update changelog for 2.4.2
chore: prepare release 2.4.2
```

## Publishing Authentication

Both `staging.yml` and `release.yml` publish through
[PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) using
`id-token: write`. There is no PyPI or TestPyPI API token stored in this repo.

| Secret | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_PAT` | repository | Used by `cut-release.yml` to open the release PR |

Neither the `staging` nor the `release` environment holds any secret. Confirm with
`gh api repos/Azure/agentops/actions/secrets --jq '.secrets[].name'`.

Trusted Publishing is configured on the index side (pypi.org and test.pypi.org →
**Manage → Publishing**) and must match the repository, workflow filename, and
environment name exactly. A mismatch fails with `403` at upload time.

### Marketplace: dedicated Entra OIDC identity

Marketplace publishing jobs use a **dedicated user-assigned managed identity (UAMI)**,
`azure/login@v3` with `allow-no-subscriptions: true`, and `id-token: write`.
No Azure RBAC grant is needed solely to publish. Publisher membership supplies
that permission. Do not change Python Trusted Publishing, shared `AZURE_*` E2E
variables, repository-wide OIDC configuration, or the GitHub `RELEASE_PAT`.

Marketplace publication is **stable-only**, through the production `vX.Y.Z`
tag flow. Previously staging could publish pre-release `X.Y.Z`, causing stable
publication of the same version to skip as a duplicate. Artifact-only staging
eliminates that collision; `package --pre-release` reserves no cloud version.

`marketplace-release` is the only required publishing environment, separate
from Python `staging`/`release`. Retain its required human reviewers and selected
branch/tag deployment policies **before enabling identity variables**:

| Environment | Allowed deployment refs |
| --- | --- |
| `marketplace-release` | Tags `v*`; optionally protected `main` for manual dispatch with tag input |
| `marketplace-staging` | Existing policy; optional legacy/read-only preflight context |
| `marketplace-validation` | Existing approved validation-ref policy; optional read-only preflight context |

The staging and validation Marketplace environments were created earlier, not
deleted by this change. Neither is required to stage/package or adds a staging
approval. `build-vsix` has no environment, `id-token`, Azure login, or profile
variables; it only produces a VSIX artifact for manual evaluation.

Stable manual job guards allow only `main` or the same release tag as the input.
An environment subject alone does not restrict branches; protections are essential.
For an authorized pre-migration-tag retry, explicitly dispatch the **new migrated
workflow on protected `main`** with a valid release tag. The Marketplace job
checks out tooling from `github.workflow_sha` at the workspace root and extension
source from `refs/tags/<tag>` into `release-source/`: old extension source uses
the new OIDC action/helper. Tag-based dispatch must match the tag input.
Re-running a historical old workflow still executes its old PAT code, not the
migrated workflow. A retry is a real publication attempt.

The publishing environment needs these variables (optional diagnostic
environments need them only when their preflight is used):

- `MARKETPLACE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: UAMI client GUID.
- `MARKETPLACE_AZURE_TENANT_ID`: approved identity tenant GUID.
- `MARKETPLACE_PROFILE_ID`: Marketplace `profiles/me` profile `id`,
  **not** the Entra principal/object ID.

Verify customization read-only with
`gh api repos/Azure/agentops/actions/oidc/customization/sub`. The verified ordered
claim keys are `repository_owner_id`, `repository_id`, `context` with
`use_default: false`. Federation must use:

- Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Audience: `api://AzureADTokenExchange`
- Release subject: `repository_owner_id:6844498:repository_id:1161883340:environment:marketplace-release`
- Optional legacy staging preflight subject: `repository_owner_id:6844498:repository_id:1161883340:environment:marketplace-staging`

Resolve the UAMI Marketplace profile using a CLI token for resource
`499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798` and a read-only request to
`https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/profile/profiles/me?api-version=7.1`.
Record only the profile `id`; never print or store token values. A publisher
Owner must grant that profile **Contributor, not Owner**, on `AgentOpsAccelerator`.

### Shared helper and local publishing

- Requires Python 3.11+ (stdlib), Azure CLI, and Node 22 with `vsce >=3.9.2`
  for publishing. Workflows pin `npm install -g @vscode/vsce@3.9.2`.
- `python scripts/marketplace.py check` is read-only: it selects
  `MARKETPLACE_AZURE_TENANT_ID`, pins the self profile to
  `MARKETPLACE_PROFILE_ID`, and checks explicit Contributor/Owner/Creator
  membership with zero deny permissions. A generic HTTP 200 is not sufficient.
- `python scripts/marketplace.py discover --out marketplace-profile.json`
  bootstraps the Marketplace profile without an expected ID or publisher access.
  Only tenant/profile IDs are written, never tokens.
- `marketplace-preflight.yml` provides discover/check via manual dispatch or a
  reviewed reusable-workflow caller. It never publishes and retains
  validation/staging/release environment choices for diagnostics. Respect the
  selected environment's existing ref policy and human review; no new
  diagnostic environment or approval is required by staging. Never create
  dummy release refs. A validation/staging-context result does not prove
  release-context authentication or actual stable publication.
- `python scripts/marketplace.py publish --package-path PATH [--pre-release] [--allow-already-exists]`
  preflights before uploading. CI opts into already-existing-version handling;
  local defaults fail. The flag maps to native `vsce --skip-duplicate`
  (existing-version/409 only), not output substring matching; other errors
  always propagate. The child environment clears inherited PAT and
  EnvironmentCredential variables and selects the tenant. **No PAT fallback.**
  Low-level `--pre-release` support is not part of the normal release flow.
- Local `scripts/staging.sh` and `scripts/staging.ps1` run lint/tests, Python
  build, TestPyPI upload, smoke verification, and VSIX artifact packaging only.
  They perform no Azure preflight or Marketplace publication. For pure
  no-upload packaging use `uv build` and extension `npm run package:prerelease`;
  the staging scripts still upload Python to TestPyPI.
- Local release scripts preflight before side effects when `vsce` exists, then
  publish stable. Their prior missing-`vsce` extension-packaging skip remains
  unchanged and does not prove Marketplace access.
  Use `check` alone for no-upload validation. First run
  `az login --tenant <publisher-identity-tenant> --allow-no-subscriptions` and set
  `MARKETPLACE_AZURE_TENANT_ID` and `MARKETPLACE_PROFILE_ID` for **your interactive
  publishing identity**, not the UAMI. Your identity needs publisher Contributor
  or Owner membership. Profile pinning prevents wrong account/tenant publishing.
- Extension `npm run publish` packages a stable VSIX before calling the shared
  helper, which preflights before upload. It requires
  Python 3.11+ and the helper from the repository checkout.
- `npm run publish:prerelease` is removed. `npm run package:prerelease` remains
  artifact-only with `package --pre-release`, not a Marketplace upload.
- CLI profile and role preflight success is **not proof of actual upload**.

### Staged rollout (not completed by merging code)

1. Confirm permanent ownership, approved production tenant/subscription
   placement, and operational responsibility under existing policy outside code
   rollout. The earlier non-production
   personal-subscription probe is feasibility evidence, not policy approval.
2. Verify the dedicated UAMI, exact release federation, publisher Contributor
   membership, `marketplace-release` reviewers and deployment policies, then
   variables. Legacy diagnostic environments are not staging prerequisites.
3. Run an authorized permission-only preflight (`check`, no publishing scripts).
   Use `marketplace-preflight.yml`: discover the profile, grant Contributor,
   then check its explicit publishing role. A local interactive `check` alone
   does not validate CI federation. Do not bypass required human approvals.
4. Verify a legitimate staging candidate's TestPyPI upload and artifact-only
   VSIX for manual evaluation. No Marketplace pre-release publication is needed.
5. Explicitly authorize a **legitimate** stable release, obtain human
   `marketplace-release` approval, and verify actual Marketplace publication.
6. **Only after actual stable publication succeeds and remaining consumers are
   checked**, remove the legacy GitHub `VSCE_PAT`. Its owner must confirm no
   other consumers before revoking the underlying Azure DevOps PAT.
   Include historical workflow re-runs in that review; retire old PAT paths
   and use the migrated workflow on `main` for authorized old-tag retries.
   **Never touch `RELEASE_PAT`.**

[Prior successful no-upload proof](https://github.com/Azure/agentops/actions/runs/34046045685/attempts/3)
used temporary resources, all since deleted. Do not claim permanent resources,
actual publication, or legacy-secret removal are complete based on that proof.
See [the release guide](../../../docs/release-process.md#104-marketplace-entra-oidc-identity-setup)
for setup and rollout details.

## Default Decision Logic

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Feature or code change | Base on `develop`, create `feature/*`, PR to `develop` |
| Release preparation | Base on `develop`, create `release/x.y.z`, update `pyproject.toml` + `CHANGELOG.md`, PR to `main` |
| Ambiguous instructions | Default to feature workflow on `develop`; do not assume a release unless explicitly requested |

## Guardrails
- Never create feature branches from `main`.
- Never open feature PRs to `main`.
- Never mix new feature work into a release branch.
- Never assign a release version on `develop`.
- Never tag without a green CI run.
- Never treat the tag push as reversible. It publishes to PyPI with no approval
  prompt, and PyPI versions can only be yanked, never replaced.
- Never end a release without running `git log --oneline origin/develop..origin/main`
  and seeing empty output.
- Never publish without running `python -m pytest tests/ -x -q` first.
- Never treat release workflows as dry runs or create dummy release branches,
  tags, or production versions to test them. Staging uploads to TestPyPI but
  packages the VSIX only. Use pure local packaging and standalone read-only
  preflight for no-upload validation. Marketplace approval does not pause Python
  publishing; GitHub Release waits for successful stable Marketplace publication.
